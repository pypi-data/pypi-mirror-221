"""

This module contains all utilities associated with brain projects, so other modules can be used to do without coupling
the brain ontology.

The `CCFv3Ontology` is an example of how to derive an ontology.

`draw_loop_in_ccf` is a visualization based on the brainrender project, also a good example.
What is tricky is that this lib needs internet connection to download the atlas, and used some deprecated functions
by other libs, so it may not work well for first-time. You might need to modify the lib's code.
running. (The usage of brainrender will block other processes from using the package, so it's dumped.)
