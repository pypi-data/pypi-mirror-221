BalderHub-RFB
=============

The BalderHub rfb package provides basic tests for testing RFB server and client devices.

.. note::
   Please note, this package is still under development and provides no full test coverage of the RFC's. If you would
   like to contribute, take a look into the `GitHub project <https://github.com/balder-dev/balderhub-rfb>`_.

This is a BalderHub package for the `Balder <https://docs.balder.dev/>`_ test framework. It allows you to test RFB
client and server devices, without the need of writing own tests. If you are new to Balder check out the
`official documentation <https://docs.balder.dev>`_ first.
