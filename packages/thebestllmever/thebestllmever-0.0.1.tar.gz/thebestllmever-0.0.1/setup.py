Clone the repository.\n\nFor detailed instructions, refer to the [Training SOP](DOCs/TRAINING.md) and [Documentation](https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda/blob/master/DOCs/DOCUMENTATION.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor detailed documentation, click [here](https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda/blob/master/DOCs/DOCUMENTATION.md).\n\n### Method 1\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Clone the repository and install the required packages:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda\ncd Andromeda\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\ncd Andromeda\npython3 train.py\n```\n\nFor further instructions, refer to the [Training SOP](DOCs/TRAINING.md).\n\n## Training\n\n1. Set the environment variables:\n   - `ENTITY_NAME`: Your wandb project name\n   - `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory to save the weights (e.g., `./weights`)\n\n2. Configure the training:\n   - Accelerate Config\n   - Enable Deepspeed 3\n   - Accelerate launch train_distributed_accelerate.py\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Training SOP](DOCs/TRAINING.md).\n\n## Dataset Building\n\nTo preprocess a different dataset similar to the C4 dataset used during training, use the `build_dataset.py` script. This script pre-tokenizes the data, chunks it into blocks of a specified sequence length, and uploads it to the Huggingface hub.\n\nExample command:\n\n```python\npython3 Andromeda/build_dataset.py --seed 42 --seq_len 8192 --hf_account "HUGGINGFACE APIKEY" --tokenizer "EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b" --dataset_name "EleutherAI/the_pile_deduplicated"\n```\n\n## Inference\n\n```python\npython3 inference.py "My dog is very cute" --seq_len 256 --temperature 0.8 --filter_thres 0.9 --model "andromeda"\n```\n\n(Note: Model submission to PyTorch Hub is still pending.)\n\n## Why Andromeda?\n\nAndromeda offers several advantages:\n\n- And romeda can potentially be fine-tuned with a 100k+ token sequence length.\n- It incorporates advanced techniques, including alibi positional bias, rotary position encodings (xpos), flash attention, and deep normalization (deepnorm), to optimize performance and efficiency.\n\nFor detailed information about the model architecture and methods, refer to the [Model Architecture](DOCs/MODEL_ARCHITECTURE.md) documentation.\n\n## Andromeda Principles\n\nAndromeda is built on key principles:\n\n- **Efficiency**: Andromeda leverages optimization techniques, such as attention flashing, rotary position encodings, and deep normalization, to achieve efficient training and inference.\n- **Flexibility**: The modular design of Andromeda allows easy adaptation to various tasks and domains, making it versatile for a wide range of applications.\n- **Scalability**: Andromeda\'s architecture is designed to scale with increasing computational resources and data sizes, ensuring its relevance in the NLP landscape.\n- **Community-driven**: As an open-source project, Andromeda thrives on contributions from the community, fostering collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement.\n\nJoin us on this exciting journey to create a powerful, efficient, and intelligent language model that will revolutionize the NLP landscape! üöÄüåü\n\n\n## Get Involved\n\nWe\'re just at the beginning of our journey. As we continue to develop and refine Andromeda, we invite you to join us. Whether you\'re a developer, researcher, or simply an enthusiast, your insights and contributions can help shape the future of Andromeda.\n\n# Contributing to Andromeda\n\nWe are thrilled to invite you to be a part of the Andromeda project. This is not just an open source project but a community initiative, and we value your expertise and creativity. To show our appreciation, we have instituted a unique rewards system that directly compensates contributors from the revenue generated by the Andromeda API.\n\n## Why Contribute\n\nContributing to Andromeda not only enhances your skills and profile but also comes with financial rewards. When you contribute code, documentation, or any form of improvement to the Andromeda project, you are adding value. As such, we believe it\'s only fair that you share in the rewards.\n\n## Rewards Program\n\nHere\'s how the Andromeda Rewards Program works:\n\n1. **Submit a Pull Request:** This can be a code enhancement, bug fix, documentation update, new feature, or any improvement to the project.\n\n2. **Review and Approval:** Our team will review your contribution. If it gets approved and merged, you become eligible for the rewards program.\n\n3. **Revenue Share:** Once your pull request is merged, you will receive a percentage of the revenue generated by the Andromeda API. The percentage will be determined based on the significance and impact of your contribution. \n\nThis means you\'re not just contributing to an open source project; you\'re becoming a part of the Andromeda ecosystem. Your efforts can yield ongoing benefits as the Andromeda API grows and evolves.\n\n## Becoming a Paid API\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we will be deploying Andromeda as a Paid API. The revenue generated from this API will not only sustain and further the project, but also fund the rewards program. If you contribute anything to make Andromeda you will receive recurring revenue from paid API requests!\n\n## How to Start Contributing\n\nIf you\'re ready to become a part of Andromeda and contribute to the future of multimodal embeddings, here\'s what you need to do:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n\n2. Make your improvements or additions in your forked repository.\n\n3. Submit a pull request detailing the changes you\'ve made.\n\n4. Our team will review your submission. If it\'s approved, it will be merged into the main repository, and you will become part of the Andromeda Rewards Program.\n\nThank you for considering contributing to Andromeda. Your expertise and commitment to this project are what make it thrive. Let\'s build the future of multimodal embeddings together.\n\n## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏èüìç\n\n1. **Training phase**: Train Andromeda on a large-scale dataset to achieve SOTA performance in various natural language processing tasks.\n\n2. **World-class inference infrastructure**: Establish a robust and efficient infrastructure that leverages techniques such as:\n\n   - Model quantization: Reduce memory and computational requirements without significant loss in performance.\n   - Distillation: Train smaller, faster models that retain the knowledge of the larger model.\n   - Optimized serving frameworks: Deploy Andromeda using efficient serving frameworks, such as NVIDIA Triton or TensorFlow Serving, for rapid inference.\n\n3. **Continuous improvement**: Continuously fine-tune Andromeda on diverse data sources and adapt it to new tasks and domains.\n\n4. **Community-driven development**: Encourage open-source contributions, including pre-processing improvements, advanced training techniques, and novel use cases.\n\n\n## Todo:\n\n* [Create the best and most validated, reliable training => finetuning strategy](https://www.figma.com/file/pfaU8Nhyw0EdXuT6z4Hutw/Andromeda-Strategy?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=Tub1wIzaPAXt2i86-1)\n\n* Establish FineTuning scripts using quantization + 4bit precision, + other tactics like LoRA\n\n* Establish 200k instruction sample long for Tool API Calls\n\n* [Train on Gorilla Dataset](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla)\n\n\n* Establish Reinforcement Scripts to train on rewards from Human and Agent feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',
