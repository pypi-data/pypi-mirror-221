Description: # ExSource-Tools
        
        An experimental Python library for validating and using the [ExSource Specification](https://gitlab.com/gitbuilding/exsourcespec) which is in the early stage of development.
        
        This packages adds the following command:
        
            exsource-make exsource.yml
        
        This will attempt to process `exsource.yml` to create inputs. The first instance of this proof of principle implementation supports OpenSCAD and some FreeCAD files. FreeCAD exporter will expect there to be a PartDesign Body called `Body`, it can export this to STEP and/or STL.
