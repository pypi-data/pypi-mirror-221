    API Reference

      # Introduction  Welcome to the REST API reference for the Zuora Billing, Payments, and Central Platform!  To learn about the common use cases of Zuora REST APIs, check out the [REST API Tutorials](https://www.zuora.com/developer/rest-api/api-guides/overview/).  In addition to Zuora API Reference, we also provide API references for other Zuora products:    * [Revenue API Reference](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/revenue/overview/)   * [Collections API Reference](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/collections/overview/)      The Zuora REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:    * Enable Web Storefront integration from your website.   * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management.   * Process revenue schedules through custom revenue rule models.   * Enable manipulation of most objects in the Zuora Billing Object Model.  Want to share your opinion on how our API works for you? <a href=\"https://community.zuora.com/t5/Developers/API-Feedback-Form/gpm-p/21399\" target=\"_blank\">Tell us how you feel </a>about using our API and what we can do to make it better.  Some of our older APIs are no longer recommended but still available, not affecting any existing integration. To find related API documentation, see [Older API Reference](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/older-api/overview/).   ## Access to the API  If you have a Zuora tenant, you can access the Zuora REST API via one of the following endpoints:  | Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints | |-------------------------|-------------------------| |US Cloud 1 Production | https://rest.na.zuora.com  | |US Cloud 1 API Sandbox |  https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com | |US Cloud 2 Production | https://rest.zuora.com | |US Cloud 2 API Sandbox | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com| |US Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.zuora.com |   |US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com | |US Production Copy | Submit a request at <a href=\"http://support.zuora.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> to enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST endpoints. See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service) Environment for existing and new customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611) for more information. | |EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com | |EU API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com | |EU Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com |  The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.   If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href=\"https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.   # Error Handling  If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1` (except [Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/tag/Actions) and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.  The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error code and message pair:  ```  {    \"success\": false,    \"processId\": \"CBCFED6580B4E076\",    \"reasons\":  [      {       \"code\": 53100320,       \"message\": \"'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN\"      }     ]  } ``` The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.  The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing, Payments, and Central Platform. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.  The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011` indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header.   When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the following Zuora error code sample:  <a href=\"https://www.zuora.com/developer/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.zuora.com/developer/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" alt=\"Zuora Error Code Sample\"></a>   **Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload. Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object and an unknown field.  The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules described in the [Error Category Codes](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/overview/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Codes) section.  In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.   ## REST API Resource Codes  The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example, `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.   The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to `679999`. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes\" target=\"_blank\">Resource Codes</a> in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.  ## Error Category Codes  The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example, resource not found or missing required field.   The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding resolution:  | Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    | |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------| | 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing tenant or user permission in the response message and contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> for enablement. | | 11      | Authentication failed       | Authentication fails due to invalid API authentication credentials. | Ensure that a valid API credential is specified. | | 20      | Invalid format or value     | The request cannot be processed due to an invalid field format or value. | Check the invalid field in the error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed in are valid. | | 21      | Unknown field in request    | The request cannot be processed because an unknown field exists in the request body. | Check the unknown field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any unknown field in the request body. | | 22      | Missing required field      | The request cannot be processed because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required fields in the request body. | | 23      | Missing required parameter  | The request cannot be processed because a required query parameter is missing. | Check the missing parameter name in the response message, and ensure that you include the parameter in the query. | | 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. | | 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource exists in your Zuora tenant. | | 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the endpoint and method matches. | | 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance.</p> | | 60      | Internal error              | The server encounters an internal error. | Contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. | | 61      | Temporary error             | A temporary error occurs during request processing, for example, a database communication error. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. </p>| | 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request limits](https://www.zuora.com/developer/rest-api/general-concepts/rate-concurrency-limits/) for details about Zuoraâ€™s concurrent request limit policy.</p> | | 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. | | 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway, tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action accordingly. |   # API Versions  The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.  ## Major Version  The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. In this API reference, only the **v1** major version is available. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.  ## Minor Version  Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it.   Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error.   If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.  If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.  You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.  For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration.   ### Minor Version History  The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.  The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.  | Fields         | Minor Version      | REST Methods    | Description | |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------| | invoiceCollect | 189.0 and earlier  | [Create Subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_Subscription \"Create Subscription\");

        asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True
        >>> thread = api.g_et_orders_by_subscription_number_with_http_info(subscription_number, async_req=True)
        >>> result = thread.get()

        :param async_req bool
        :param str subscription_number: The subscription number. (required)
        :param str accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :param str content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
        :param str authorization: The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
        :param str zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
        :param str zuora_entity_ids: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 
        :param int page: The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response. 
        :param int page_size: The number of records returned per page in the response. 
        :param str date_filter_option: The date type to filter on. This field value can be 'orderDate' or 'updatedDate'. Default is orderDate. 
        :param date start_date: The result will only contain the orders with the date of 'dateFilterOption' later than or equal to this date. 
        :param date end_date: The result will only contain the orders with the date of 'dateFilterOption' earlier than or equal to this date.

If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations: * [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) * [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)  Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.   # noqa: E501

        :param str idempotency_key: Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  
        :param str accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :param str content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
        :param str authorization: The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
        :param str zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
        :param str zuora_entity_ids: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 
        :param bool return_ids: Specify whether to return IDs for the [Get job status and response](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/GET_JobStatusAndResponse) operation. If you set this query parameter to `true`, the corresponding IDs, which are associated with the numbers returned in this operation, can be returned in the \"Get job status and response\" response body. 
        :param str zuora_version:  The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You need to set this parameter if you want to use the following fields: * subscriptions * subscriptionNumbers * subscriptionIds (when the `returnId` query parameter is set to `true`)

The following tutorials demonstrate how to use this operation:   * [Create a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Create_a_Subscription)  * [Add a Product to a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Add_a_Product_to_a_Subscription)  * [Create a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/B_Create_a_Ramp_Deal)  * [Add a Product Mid-Interval Update on a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/E_Update_a_Product_in_a_Ramp_Deal)  * [Add a Product in a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/C_Add_a_Product_in_a_Ramp_Deal)  * [Change the Terms and Conditions of a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/D_Change_the_Terms_and_Conditions_of_a_Ramp_Deal_and_Update_the_Ramp)  * [Change the Owner of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Owner_of_a_Subscription)  * [Change the Terms and Conditions of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Terms_and_Conditions_of_a_Subscription)  * [Renew a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription)  * [Renew a Subscription and Upgrade a Product](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription_and_Upgrade_a_Product)  * [Replace a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Replace_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)  * [Update a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Update_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)  * [Cancel a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Cancel_a_Subscription)  * [Remove a Product from a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Remove_a_Product_from_a_Subscription)  * [Create a sales order line item without fulfillments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AC_Create_a_sales_order_line_item_without_fulfillments)  * [Create a sales order line item with fulfillments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AD_Create_a_sales_order_line_item_with_fulfillments)  * [Create an order line item with a new subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AE_Create_an_order_line_item_with_a_new_subscription)  * [Create a return order line item without fulfillments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AF_Create_a_return_order_line_item_without_fulfillments)  * [Create a return order line item with fulfillments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/Create_a_return_order_line_item_with_fulfillments)  **Note:** If you received a timeout error message when creating an order, the call is still running in the backend and the order will be created.  The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000.  The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100.  Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation:  * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.  If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations: * [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) * [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)  Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.   **Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same \"Create an order\" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action).   **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.   # noqa: E501

With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  
        :param str accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :param str content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

        :param str zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
        :param str zuora_entity_ids: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.
