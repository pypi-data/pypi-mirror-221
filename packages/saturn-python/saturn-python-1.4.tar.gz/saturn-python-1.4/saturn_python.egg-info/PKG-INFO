Description: # saturn
        
        A Python library that allows to rerun a script multiple times without stopping
        the process and keeping the scope (like it is done in
        [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in code sections).
        The goal is to keep in RAM the datasets that are expensive to load in each run.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install saturn-python
        ```
        
        ## Basic example
        
        ```python
        # example.py
        
        import saturn
        
        @saturn.main
        def main(scope):
            if not saturn.defined('scope.a', scope):  # OR if 'a' not in scope:
                scope.a = 42
            scope.a += 1
            print(scope.a)
        ```
        
        Run:
        
        ```
        $ saturn
        Welcome to Saturn terminal where you can reruns your Python module keeping its scope in RAM. Version 1.0.
        S>>> run example
        43
        S>>> run example
        44
        S>>> print(scope)
        {'a': 44}
        S>>> exit
        $

        ## Work with sections
        
        ```python
        # example.py
        
        import saturn
        
        @saturn.main
        def main(scope):
            print('main')
        
            if saturn.section('a'):
                print('section a')
        
            if saturn.section('b'):
                print('section b')
        ```
        
        Run:
        
        ```
