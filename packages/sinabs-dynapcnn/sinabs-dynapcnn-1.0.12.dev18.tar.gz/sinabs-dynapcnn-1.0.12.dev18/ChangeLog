* documentation improvement
* replace curl with wget
* update ChangeLog
* replace all math equation
* Added board resetting before second test. Note that the device will be opened already before the second test starts, so it is not actually necessary

v1.0.10
-------

* update samna version requirements
* update ChangeLog
* add speck2f module devkit support and remove speck2f characterization board support
* Implementation a test that will create a single neuron on a single core, that receives a single event and outputs a single event
* edit visualizer.md
* Added the visualizer documentation to the index.rst
* Replacing the notebook which cannot spawn a samnagui window with a markdown file
* Visualizer example updated with the window scale parameter
* Window scale parameter is now passed to the constructor
* load model onto CPU and change warning message for JIT compilation
* exclude Samna visualiser generated file
* Samna version requirement incremented to cover the latest changes
* fix errors in using\_radout\_layer.ipynb
* merge conflicts
* update ChangeLog
* modify config making tests can cover different types of devkits
* add speck2f characterization board support
* fix errors in tests after init DVSLayer in any case
* make DVSLayer can be initnitialized in anycase
* black formatted
* renamed test

v1.0.9
------

* update ChangeLog
* update figure
* add a time.sleep statement after dynapcnn network reset-states to wait the config take effect
* test updated to check for type
* added checks if the network is empty
* add spike count visualization notebook into tutorials.rst
* fix typo in the notebook of visualize spike count
* delete chip top level figure
* change the speck top level figure path
* change top level figure
* modify the parent folder name identical to the notebook
* Fix to the issue
* Change last uint
* Remove comment
* Uint64 to int
* Check the timestamp and delay factor for negative values
* Casting to int after conversion
* Do not sleep while resetting the states when the function is called. Stop the input graph, while the neuron values are written. Sleep for a bit and then start the graph again
* update ChangeLog after add support of speck2e
* add speck2e devkit and testboard support
* Device input graph stopped on destruction of the DynapcnnNetwork object
* Writing all v mem to zeros changed. -> Now when you call this method it creates a temporary buffer and a temporary graph, starts the graph, writes the events, stops the graph then it is destroyed
* Implement an input buffer for all devices: -> In the config\_builder there is now a function called get\_input\_buffer which gives a source node. -> For each chip this is implemented to get the appropriate source node. -> To method changed to construct the input buffer. -> Forward method changed to write the events to this source node

v1.0.8
------

* Type definition updated to Tuple
* compatibility with torch 1.13

v1.0.7
------

* requirement bumped to 1.0.7

v1.0.5
