 -999 indicates counts or percentages are not available (i.e. masked) to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Masked numbers are typically small although larger numbers may be masked to prevent imputation.

The REPORT_NUMBER column and the LINE_GROUP_NUMBER column are added to assist sorting and filtering of rows in the file.
