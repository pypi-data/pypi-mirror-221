*SINr* is an open-source tool to efficiently compute graph and word
embeddings. Its aim is to provide sparse interpretable vectors from a
graph structure. The dimensions of the vector produced are related to
the community structure detected in the graph. By leveraging the
relative connection of vertices to communities, *SINr* builds an
interpretable space. *SINr* is focused on providing tools to build and
interpret the embeddings produced.

*SINr* is a Python module relying on
`Networkit <https://networkit.github.io>`__ for the graph structure and
community detection. *SINr* also provides efficient implementations to
extract word co-occurrence graphs from large text corpora. One of the
strength of *SINr* is its ability to work with text and produce
interpretable word embeddings that are competitive with similar
approaches. For more details on the performances of *SINr* on downstream
evaluation tasks, please refer to the `Publications <#publications>`__
section.

Requirements
============

-  As SINr relies on libraries implemented using C/C++, a modern C++
   compiler is required.
-  OpenMP (required for `Networkit <https://networkit.github.io>`__ and
   compiling *SINr*\ ’s Cython
-  Python 3.9
-  Pip
-  Cython
-  Conda (recommended)

Install
=======

SINr can be installed through ``pip`` or from source using ``poetry``
directives.

pip
---

.. code:: bash

   conda activate sinr # activate conda environment
   pip install sinr

from source
-----------

.. code:: bash

   conda activate sinr # activate conda environment
   git clone git@github.com:SINr-Embeddings/sinr.git
   cd sinr
   pip install poetry # poetry solves dependencies and installs SINr
   poetry install # installs SINr based on the pyproject.toml file

Usage example
=============

To get started using *SINr* to build graph and word embeddings, have a
look at the `notebook <./notebooks>`__ directory.

Here is a minimum working example of *SINr*

.. code:: python

       import urllib
       import io
       import gzip
       import networkit as nk
       import sinr.graph_embeddings as ge


       url = "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.txt.gz"
       graph_file = "wikipedia-votes.txt"
       # Read a graph from SNAP
       sock = urllib.request.urlopen(url)  # open URL
       s = io.BytesIO(sock.read())  # read into BytesIO "file"
       sock.close()
       with gzip.open(s, "rt") as f_in:
           with open(graph_file, "wt") as f_out:
               f_out.writelines(f_in.readlines())
       # Initialize a networkit.Graph object from SNAP graph
       G = nk.readGraph(graph_file, nk.Format.SNAP)

       # Build a SINr model and extract embeddings
       model = ge.SINr.load_from_graph(G)
       model.run(algo=nk.community.PLM(G))
       embeddings = model.get_nr()
       print(embeddings)
