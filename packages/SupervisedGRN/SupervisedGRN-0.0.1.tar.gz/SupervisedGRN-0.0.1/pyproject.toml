description = "This package leverages both supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques to construct robust predictive models from transcriptomic data. It is designed to train on this high-dimensional data, extract key features, and make accurate predictions. The models generated can be used to uncover complex biological relationships and predict outcomes such as gene regulatory network behaviors, offering valuable insights for genomics and bioinformatics research."
