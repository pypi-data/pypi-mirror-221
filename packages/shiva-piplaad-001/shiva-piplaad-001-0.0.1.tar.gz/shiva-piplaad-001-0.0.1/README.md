# Shiva-piplaad

__Shiva-Piplaad__ is an AI module created by [TheAIHub.app](theaihub.app) which aims to automate mundane tasks such as data entry, document organization, and general administrative duties to reduce the amount of time human personnel dedicate to them. It utilizes a library of artificial intelligence technologies and algorithms, including natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) technologies, and machine learning (ML) algorithms. It will also be integrated with web services such as e-commerce and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms to facilitate customer-facing services. __Shiva-Piplaad's main goal__ is to create a fully-automated digital workplace, allowing human personnel to focus on more complex tasks, while also being an open-source AI platform for developers to customize and extend as needed.

## Overview

**Shiva-Piplaad** is an experimental AI module created by [TheAIHub.app](theaihub.app) that will utilize its base **Shiva module** to complete various automated tasks. The focus of Shiva-Piplaad is to automate mundane processes such as data entry, document organization, and general administrative tasks to reduce the amount of time human personnel dedicate to them.

Shiva-Piplaad works by utilizing the Shiva module's extensive library of **artificial intelligence technologies and algorithms** to identify what processes need to be automated. This process includes **data extraction using natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) technologies**. Shiva-Piplaad will then utilize **machine learning (ML) algorithms** to create a custom plan for each automated task. This plan will be tailored to fit the requirements of the organization or individual, promoting accuracy and efficiency. 

Shiva-Piplaad will also feature integration with other web services such as **e-commerce and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms**. This will allow humans to access data stored in those platforms and utilize Shiva-Piplaad to automate tasks such as customer communication, e-mail campaigns, data collection, and other customer-facing services.

The main objective of Shiva-Piplaad is to facilitate a **fully-automated digital workplace** that can be used to streamline mundane and highly-repetitive tasks. This will allow human personnel to focus on more complex tasks, boosting creativity and collaboration in the workplace. Finally, **Shiva-Piplaad will be an open-source AI platform**, allowing developers to customize and extend its automation capabilities as needed.
