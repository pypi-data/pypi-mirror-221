    """
    Backend that generates nuclear, hydro and thermal from consumption and renewable production constraints by
    computing an optimized economic dispatch.
    Constraints on generators and consumption, solar, wind and loss chronics are provided
    via an instance of :class:`chronix2grid.dispatch.EconomicDispatch.Dispatcher` object

    Attributes
    ----------
    dispatcher: :class:`chronix2grid.dispatch.EconomicDispatch.Dispatcher`
        Object that contains grid and chronics features that represents the dispatch constraints and environment
    scenario_folder_path: ``str``
        path to output folder for generated chronics
    grid_folder: ``str``
        folder in which grid info are stored
    seed_disp: ``int``
    params: ``dict``
        dictionnary with the model parameters. It needs to contain keys **"dt", "planned_std"**
    params_opf: ``dict``
        dictionnary with specific parameters concerning the dispatch optimization (Optimal Power Flow computation)
