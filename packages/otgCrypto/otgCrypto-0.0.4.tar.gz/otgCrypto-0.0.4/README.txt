OTG Cryptography
Introduction
The expansion of OTG cryptography is One Time Gamble. It is a hybrid and lightweight cryptographic algorithm that transforms a plaintext into a ciphertext so that secret communication is to be ensured. The original password is hidden under several fake passwords in a vault. Also, these passwords are hashed by bcrypt hash function which is a one-way encryption and cannot be reversed. Moreover, the secret message will be deleted by itself if a user gives wrong password only at once. As a result, it will be so much difficult for a hacker to guess, retrieve and use the password correctly among fake passwords. Furthermore, the key is 128 bits long. So, a hacker needs to go for 2128 = 3.402e+38 possible ways in terms of finding the correct key to decrypt the ciphertext. It is by far impossible for a regular user device to solve the math. It will need super computer to do the computation. However, a low computational powered device (e.g. IOT device) can easily handle it because of its symmetric and stream cipher architecture. Thus, it makes the algorithm lightweight. Also, OTG is a software and hardware independent cryptography. In conclusion, this new innovation can make a fruitful impact in todayâ€™s security epidemic.

Ideal applications to use in Government Secret Message, Sensitive Business Communication and Low Computational Powered Device.

This program utilizes:
A user inputed password.
A user inputed secret message.
A hardcoded dictionary of secret messages.
A dictionary containing manipulated (fake) passwords in addition to the real password.
A dictionary containing seeds (Seed generator). Seeds are simply pointers that point to the secret message.
The encryption algorithm: cipher = password XOR key
The decrpytion algorithm: key = password XOR cipher.
A try/except block to search for actual password that do exist in the password dictionary.
The message will be deleted if a user give wrong password.
