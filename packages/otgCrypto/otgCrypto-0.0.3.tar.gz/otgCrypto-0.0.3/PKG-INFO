The expansion of OTG cryptography is One Time Gamble. 
    It is a hybrid and lightweight cryptographic algorithm that transforms a plaintext into a ciphertext so that secret communication is to be ensured. 
    The original password is hidden under several fake passwords in a vault. Also, these passwords are hashed by bcrypt hash function which is a one-way encryption and cannot be reversed. Moreover, the secret message will be deleted by itself if a user gives wrong password only at once. 
    As a result, it will be so much difficult for a hacker to guess, retrieve and use the password correctly among fake passwords. 
    Furthermore, the key is 128 bits long. So, a hacker needs to go for 2128 = 3.402e+38 possible ways in terms of finding the correct key to decrypt the ciphertext. 
    It is by far impossible for a regular user device to solve the math. It will need super computer to do the computation. 
    However, a low computational powered device (e.g. IOT device) can easily handle it because of its symmetric and stream cipher architecture. 
    Thus, it makes the algorithm lightweight. Also, OTG is a software and hardware independent cryptography. 
    In conclusion, this new innovation can make a fruitful impact in todayâ€™s security epidemic.
