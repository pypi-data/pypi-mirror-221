## CHUNGUS

*IN ALL TEXT BELOW, LARGE BRACKETS({}) MEANS FOR YOU TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING *

CHUNKY MOD THAT LAGS AND TAKES UP SPACE

**To troll your friends(METHOD 1: Harder but less sus):**

Step 1: Prepare

You need a setup like this:

`{name}`

|----`{name}`

. . . . |-----`__init__.py`

. . . . |-----`{name}.py`

|----`README.md`

|----`LICENSE`

|_ _ `setup.py`

Step 2: Write code

In `{name}.py`, write `import chunky`

In README.md, write a description(like this description is!)

In LICENSE, you use "No License" as my Apache 2.0 does not let you publish publicly. You cannot publish this publicly in any way, however you can spread word about the original Chungus module by me. Use PyModuleDev as my name.

In setup.py, write this:

```
from setuptools import setup
with open("README.md", "r", encoding="utf-8")as fh:    long_description = fh.read()
setup(
name="{name}",
version="0.0.0",author="{your_name}",   author_email="{your_email}",    description="Chunky Module",    long_description=long_description,    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",    packages=["snoringness"],    classifiers=[        "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable",        "Intended Audience :: Developers",        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3"    ],    python_requires=">=3.6")
```

Step 3: Write commands

Open the Python terminal. There, use the cd command to navigate to the directory your `setup.py` is in. Now type `pip install setuptools` and run. Last, type `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` and that's it! Look inside the newly added `build` and `dist` folders and find the `.tar.gz` file OR the `.whl` file. Distribute these files any PRIVATE way you want. Distributing publicly would "disturb" the Apache License 2.0.


**To troll your friends(Easier but more sus):**

Have your friend run `pip install chungus`. Thats it!
