# Element Unify Connector Framework

The Unify Python Connector Framework is a library to develop connectors that interact
with Element Unify. This library is intended for developers who are building connectors to
ingest source input data to Element Unify or publish data from Element Unify to another
destination.

## User Information

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    echo unify-connector-framework >> requirements.txt

Then, in your python import section add the following line:

    from unifyconnectorframework.organization_client import OrganizationClient
