# Machine Learning Starter

## Introduction
My library, named "MLStarter" which stands for Machine Learning Starter, is a comprehensive Python toolkit meticulously crafted to cater to the needs of machine learning beginners. With a user-friendly design, it aims to empower aspiring data enthusiasts and learners in the fields of machine learning and data analysis. Each module in "MLStarter" serves a distinct purpose, providing a seamless and efficient experience for users throughout the entire machine learning journey.

By combining ease of use with powerful functionality, this library aims to nurture your understanding and practical skills in machine learning, unlocking the doors to endless possibilities in the realm of data-driven solutions. So, embrace "MaLL" and embark on a rewarding journey of mastering the art of machine learning!

## Installation
You can install MLStarter using pip:
```
pip install mlstarter
```

## Quick Start
Here's a quick example of how to use MLStarter Library:

```python
# Import modules
from mlstarter.datasets import StandardDataset
from mlstarter.mlsolutions import KNearestNeighbor

# Load the datasets
ds = StandardDataset()
ds.load_knn('numeric')
X, y = ds.data, ds.target
new_example = ds.new_example 

# Call a particular algorithm
knn = KNearestNeighbor(k=3)
knn.fit(X, y)
knn.predict(new_example)
print(knn)

# Ouputs:
# The closest nearest neighbors are ex.1, 0, 2. The majority of Label is yes; hence, 3-Nearest Neighbor predicts Label = yes.
```
