# firefish.py

Simple python wrapper for the Firefish API.

## Getting started

You're going to want to install requests and python-dotenv in order for this to work.

You can either install this with pypi by doing `pip install firefish.py` or by building it yourself.

I'm running this with 3.11.3, which is (i think) the latest Python3 version and it should work with all versions of Python3. I haven't tested it though

Once you install firefish.py, create a .env file with the following:

```
TOKEN=<your firefish api token>
INSTANCE=<the firefish instance associated with your api token>
```

Don't include the < > keys when typing them in, and format your instance as "subdomain.domain.com".
lethallava.land is a pretty decent public Firefish instance if you don't already have an account on an instance.

Additionally, keep in mind that this *might* work on Misskey as well. You can try, but keep in mind I haven't tested Misskey out for myself yet.

## Examples

Simple posting bot: 

```
import firefish
firefish.createnote('example', 'null')
```
