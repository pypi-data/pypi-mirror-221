class Gradient(Node):
    r"""
    Calculate the gradients for all the variables.

    The gradient is a list containing all the first partial derivatives
    of the `tensor` with respect to the `variables`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : Tensor(real)
        The real tensor :math:`T` whose gradient vector you want to
        calculate. If the tensor is not scalar, each dimension belongs to a batch.
    variables : list[Tensor(real)]
        The list of real variables :math:`\{\theta_i\}` with respect to
        which you want to take the first partial derivatives of the
        tensor. If batching is used, each variable must have the same
        batch dimension as `tensor` (or must be broadcastable to it).
    name : str, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    Sequence[Tensor(real)]
        A list of gradients containing the first partial derivatives of the
        `tensor` :math:`T` with respect to the `variables` :math:`\{\theta_i\}`.

    Warnings
    --------
    This function currently doesn't support calculating a gradient vector for
    a graph which includes an `infidelity_pwc` node if it involves a Hamiltonian
    with degenerate eigenvalues at any segment. In that case, the function
    returns a `nan` gradient vector.

    Notes
    -----
    The :math:`i` element of the gradient contains the partial
    derivative of the `tensor` with respect to the ith
    `variables`:

    .. math::
        (\nabla T)_{i} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta_i}.

    The variables :math:`\{\theta_i\}` follow the same sequence as the
    input list of `variables` and each element has the same shape as the
    corresponding one in the `variables` list.

class Hessian(Node):
    r"""
    Calculate a single Hessian matrix for all the variables.

    The Hessian is a matrix containing all the second partial derivatives
    of the `tensor` with respect to the `variables`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : Tensor(scalar, real)
        The real scalar tensor :math:`T` whose Hessian matrix you want to
        calculate.
    variables : list[Tensor(real)]
        The list of real variables :math:`\{\theta_i\}` with respect to
        which you want to take the second partial derivatives of the
        tensor. If any of the tensors of the list is not scalar, this
        function treats each of the elements of the tensor as a different
        variable. It does this by flattening all tensors and concatenating
        them in the same sequence that you provided in this list.
    name : str, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor(2D, real)
        The real Hessian matrix :math:`H` containing the second partial
        derivatives of the `tensor` :math:`T` with respect to the
        `variables` :math:`\{\theta_i\}`.

    Warnings
    --------
    This function currently doesn't support calculating a Hessian matrix for
    a graph which includes an `infidelity_pwc` node if it involves a Hamiltonian
    with degenerate eigenvalues at any segment. In that case, the function
    returns a `nan` Hessian matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    The :math:`(i,j)` element of the Hessian contains the partial
    derivative of the `tensor` with respect to the ith and the jth
    `variables`:

    .. math::
        H_{i,j} = \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}.

    The variables :math:`\{\theta_i\}` follow the same sequence as the
    input list of `variables`. If some of the `variables` are not scalars,
    this function flattens them and concatenates them in the same order of
    the list of `variables` that you provided to create the sequence of
    scalar variables :math:`\{\theta_i\}`.

    If you choose a negative log-likelihood as the tensor :math:`T`, you
    can use this Hessian as an estimate of the Fisher information matrix.
