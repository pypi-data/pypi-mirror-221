    Filter a piecewise-constant function with a sinc filter and resample it again.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : Graph
        The graph object where the node will belong.
    pwc : Pwc
        The piecewise-constant function :math:`\alpha(t)` to be filtered.
    cutoff_frequency : float
        Upper limit :math:`\omega_c` of the range of angular frequencies that you want to
        preserve in your function.
    segment_count : int
        The number of segments of the resampled filtered function.
    duration : float, optional
        Force the resulting piecewise-constant function to have a certain duration.
        This option is mainly to avoid floating point errors when the total duration is
        too small. If not provided, it is set to the sum of segment durations of `pwc`.
        Defaults to None.
    name : str, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    Pwc
        The filtered and resampled piecewise-constant function.

    See Also
    --------
    :func:`Graph.convolve_pwc` :
        Create the convolution of a piecewise-constant function with a kernel.
    :func:`Graph.discretize_stf` :
        Create a piecewise-constant function by discretizing a sampleable function.
    :func:`Graph.sinc_convolution_kernel` :
        Create a convolution kernel representing the sinc function.

    Notes
    -----
    The resulting filtered function is

    .. math::
        \int_{-\infty}^\infty \alpha(\tau)
        \frac{\sin[\omega_c (t-\tau)]}{\pi (t-\tau)} \mathrm{d}\tau
        = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\omega_c}^{\omega_c}
        e^{i \omega t} \hat\alpha(\omega) \mathrm{d}\omega

    where

    .. math::
        \hat\alpha(\omega)
        =\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-i \omega \tau}\alpha(\tau) \mathrm{d}\tau

    is the Fourier transform of :math:`\alpha(t)`. Hence the filter eliminates components of
    the signal that have angular frequencies greater than :math:`\omega_c`.
