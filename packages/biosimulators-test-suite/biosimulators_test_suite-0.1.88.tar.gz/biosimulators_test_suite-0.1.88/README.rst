BioSimulators test suite
========================

The BioSimulators test suite is a tool for validating that biosimulation
software tools implement the `BioSimulators conventions for
biosimulation
tools <https://docs.biosimulations.org/concepts/conventions/>`__.

The test suite is composed of two parts:

-  `A collection of example modeling projects <examples>`__. Each
   project is represented by a single `COMBINE/OMEX
   archive <https://combinearchive.org/>`__ that contains one or more
   simulation experiments described using the `Simulation Experiment
   Description Markup Language (SED-ML) <https://sed-ml.org>`__ and one
   or more models described using a format such as the `BioNetGen
   Language (BNGL) <https://bionetgen.org>`__ or the `Systems Biology
   Markup Language (SBML) <http://sbml.org>`__.

-  Software for checking that biosimulation tools execute these projects
   according to the BioSimulators conventions.

   -  Simulation tools support the `BioSimulators standard command-line
      arguments <https://docs.biosimulations.org/concepts/conventions/simulator-interfaces/>`__.
   -  Simulation tools support the `BioSimulators conventions for Docker
      images <https://docs.biosimulations.org/concepts/conventions/simulator-images/>`__.
   -  Simulation tools follow the `BioSimulators conventions for
      executing simulations described by SED-ML files in COMBINE/OMEX
      archives <https://docs.biosimulations.org/concepts/conventions/simulation-experiments/>`__.
   -  Simulation tools support the `BioSimulators conventions for the
      outputs of SED-ML files in COMBINE/OMEX
      archives <https://docs.biosimulations.org/concepts/conventions/simulation-run-reports/>`__.
