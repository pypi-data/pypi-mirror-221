    """
    This class verifies the presence of "pandas" and "tensorflow" import statements, tracks the occurrence of
    for-loop and while-loop constructs, and applies a depth-first search within these loop statements to identify
    instances of "pandas" or "tensorflow" as inferred strings.

    TITLE = "Avoid unnecessary iterations. Use vectorized solutions instead of loops."
    DESCRIPTION = """
    Context:
    Loops are typically time-consuming and verbose, while
    developers can usually use some vectorized solutions to replace the
    loops.

    Problem:
    As stated in the Pandas documentation: “Iterating
    through pandas objects is generally slow. In many cases, iterating
    manually over the rows is not needed and can be avoided”. It
    is also stated that the slicing operation with loops in TensorFlow is
    slow, and there is a substitute for better performance.

    Solution:
    Machine learning applications are typically data-intensive,
    requiring operations on data sets rather than an individual
    value. Therefore, it is better to adopt a vectorized solution
    instead of iterating over data. In this way, the program runs faster
