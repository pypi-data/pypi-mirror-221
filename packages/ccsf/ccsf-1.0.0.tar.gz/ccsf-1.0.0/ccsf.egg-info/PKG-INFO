Leveraging cell-cell similarity for high-performance spatial and temporal cellular mappings from gene expression data (Cell Patterns, 2023)

## CCSF is a replacement of PCA for gene expression and other tabular data analysis
CCSF is a cell-cell similarity-driven framework of genomic data analysis for high-fidelity dimensionality reduction, clustering, visualization, and spatial and temporal cellular mappings. 
The approach exploits the similarity features of the cells for the discovery of discriminative patterns in the data. 
For a wide variety of datasets, the proposed approach drastically improves the accuracies of visualization and spatial and temporal mapping analyses as compared to PCA and state-of-the-art techniques. 
Computationally, the method is about 15 times faster than the existing ones and thus provides an urgently needed technique  for reliable and efficient analysis of genomic data.
