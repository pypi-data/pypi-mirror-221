        This API is used to start an on-cloud recording task. It records the audio and video streams in a room and saves them to the specified cloud storage. You can use this API to record the streams in a room separately, or you can mix the streams first and then record the mixed stream.

        You can use this API to perform the following operations:
        * Specify the anchors whose streams you want or do not want to record by using the `RecordParams` parameter
        * Specify the storage service you want to save recording files to by using the `StorageParams` parameter. Currently, you can save recording files to Tencent Cloud VOD or COS.
        * Specify transcoding settings for mixed-stream recording, including video resolution, video bitrate, frame rate, and audio quality, by using `MixTranscodeParams`
        * Specify the layout of different videos in mixed-stream recording mode or select an auto-arranged layout template

        Key concepts:
        * Single-stream recording: Record the audio and video of each subscribed user (`UserId`) in a room and save the recording files to the storage you specify.
        Mixed-stream recording: Mix the audios and videos of subscribed users (`UserId`) in a room, record the mixed stream, and save the recording files to the storage you specify. After a recording task ends, you can go to the VOD console (https://console.tencentcloud.com/vod/media) or [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/bucket) to view the recording files.

    def StartPublishCdnStream(self, request):
        """This API is used to mix streams and relay the mixed stream to CDNs. You can use this API to do the following:
        1. Publish (also known as "relay") the audio/video stream of one anchor to CDNs. For details, see example 2 (starting a task to relay the audio and video of a stream) and example 3 (starting a task to relay only the audio of a stream).
        2. Mix the streams of multiple anchors in a room or in different rooms and publish the mixed stream to CDNs. You can use `AudioParams.SubscribeAudioList` to specify the users whose audios are mixed, and use `VideoParams.LayoutParams` to specify the layout of the anchorsâ€™ videos. For details, see example 1 (mixing streams and publishing the mixed stream to a CDN).
        3. Mix multiple streams in a room according to a template and publish the mixed stream to CDNs. The TRTC backend will detect the change of anchors in the room and adjust the video layout automatically according to the stream mixing template. The following template types are supported:
             - Floating: The entire screen is covered by the video of the first user who enters the room, and the videos of other users are displayed as small windows in rows in the bottom-left corner in room entry sequence. The screen allows up to 4 rows of 4 small videos, which float over the large video. Up to 1 large and 15 small videos can be displayed.
             - Grid: The videos of all users split the screen evenly. The more the users, the smaller the video dimensions. Up to 16 videos are supported.
             - Screen sharing: This is designed for video conferencing and online education. The shared screen (or camera video of the anchor) is always displayed as the large video, which occupies the left half of the screen, and the videos of other users occupy the right half in up to two columns of up to eight small videos each. Up to 1 large video and 15 small videos can be displayed. If the upstream aspect ratio does not match the output, the large video on the left will be scaled and displayed in whole, while the small videos on the right will be cropped.
        4. Publish audio/video streams to up to 10 CDNs at a time. You can use `PublishCdnParams.PublishCdnUrl` to specify the URLs of the CDNs to publish to. To publish to Tencent Cloudâ€™s CDN, set `PublishCdnParams.IsTencentCdn` to 1.
        5. Configure a server-side callback to have Tencent Cloud send relay status updates to your server in the form of HTTP/HTTPS POST requests. To use the callback for relay events, please contact Technical Support.
        6. The API supports four regions: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong. If you relay to regions outside the Chinese mainland, select Hong Kong.

        Notes:
        1. **Because On-Cloud MixTranscoding is a paid feature, calling this API will incur MixTranscoding fees. For details, see [Billing of MixTranscoding and Relay to CDN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/49446?from_cn_redirect=1).**
        2. **Relaying to third-party CDNs will incur relaying fees. For details, see [Billing of MixTranscoding and Relay to CDN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/82155?from_cn_redirect=1).**

        Others:
        1. You need to first call `StartPublishCdnStream` to start a relay task and get the task ID before you can use the `UpdatePublishCdnStream` API to modify the task and `StopPublishCdnStream` to stop the task.
        2. To ensure the stability of relaying, you cannot switch between relaying audio only, relaying audio and video, and relaying video only for the same task.
        3. To ensure the stability of relaying, you cannot change the video codec, audio codec, audio sample rate, audio bitrate, or sound channels using the `UpdatePublishCdnStream` API. We recommend you pass in all the other parameters when calling `UpdatePublishCdnStream`. If you only want to enable/disable transcoding, make sure you pass in all the other parameters.
        4. When you relay a single stream, specify both `AudioParams` and `VideoParams` to publish both audio and video, and specify only `AudioParams` to publish audio only. You cannot switch between the two modes during the relaying process. For `VideoParams`, set `Width`, `Height`, `Fps`, `Bitrate`, and `Gop` according to the actual settings used for publishing.
        5. The `SequenceNumber` parameter is required when you call `UpdatePublishCdnStream` to change the relaying parameters. It ensures that multiple requests for the same relaying task are in the correct order. The value of `SequenceNumber` increases each time a new request is made for the same task. If `InternalError` is returned, try again using the same `SequenceNumber`. You donâ€™t need to handle the `FailedOperation.OutdateRequest` error.
        6. You can create a relay task before anchors enter a room, in which case you need to manually call `StopPublishCdnStream` to stop the task. If you donâ€™t, after all the users whose streams are mixed leave the room, the TRTC backend will wait for the timeout period (`AgentParams.MaxIdleTime`) to elapse before stopping the relaying task.
