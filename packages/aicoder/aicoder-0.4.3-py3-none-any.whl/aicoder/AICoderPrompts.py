The main file should be called 'main' with the extension (e.g. 'main.py'), it must contain the flow of the program so it should be the one importing from the rest.

The JSON must have this structure:

In every file that isn't a main file, add in the depedencies the path to the main file that is relevant for it (notice that several main files could be needed if the program is big).

If needed don't forget headers '.h' and  implementations '.c, .cpp, .m'...
