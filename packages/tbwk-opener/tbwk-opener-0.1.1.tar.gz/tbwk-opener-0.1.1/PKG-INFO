# tbwk-opener
A python package to open and read tbwk files generated from the NanoDrop 2000 software.

Testing: ![Python application](https://github.com/Gillingham-Lab/tbwk-opener/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

## Features
This library has so far only been tested with Nucleic Acid worksheets.

- Can import tbwk files to read measurements contained within the file
- Successfully reads y- and x-values of a recorded spectrum
- Also reports on tabled data contained in the worksheet (such as A260 for nucleic acids, 
or direct nucleic concentration as chosen by the method)

A protein worksheet (no example provided) showed similar behaviour and should work without any issues.

## Installation

Make sure you've installed numpy and scipy before attempting to install tbwk-opener from pip, then use:

```shell script
pip install tbwk-opener
```

## Usage

Get all measurements from a worksheet and report on concentration using the absorption at 260 nm:

```python
from tbwk import Worksheet

worksheet = Worksheet.import_worksheet("examples/nanodrop-dna-measurements-01.twbk")

factor = (2.05 + 2.30)/2 # Î¼M per absorption unit
for measurement in worksheet:
    print(f"{measurement.title:20}{measurement.get_absorption_at(260)*factor:.2f} Î¼M")
```
