    '''
    Compute the LDL-Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian positive definite matrix A
    so that it holds

    where L is a (in general complex) lower triangular matrix with ones on its diagonal.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    A: ndarray
        Matrix to be factorized.
        
    Returns
    -------
    L: ndarray
        A lower triangular matrix with ones on its diagonal.
        
    D: ndarray
        A diagonal matrix

        The inverse of the square root of D
