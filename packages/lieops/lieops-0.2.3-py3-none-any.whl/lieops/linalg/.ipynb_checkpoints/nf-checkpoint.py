    X.transpose()@J@X = J.
    
    Then this routine will determine two matrices A and B so that
    X = exp(A)@exp(B),
    where A is an element in sp(n), the Lie-algebra of Sp(n) = Sp(2n; C) \cap U(2n),
    and B is an element of sp(2n; C), the Lie-algebra of Sp(2n; C).

def normal_form(H2, T=None, mode='default', check: bool=False, **kwargs):
    r'''
    Perform linear calculations to transform a given second-order Hamiltonian,
    expressed in canonical coordinates (q, p), to
    complex normal form coordinates xi, eta. Along the way, the symplectic linear map to
    real normal form is computed. The quantities xi and eta are defined as in my thesis,
    Chapter 1.
    
    Paramters
    ---------
    H2:
        Symmetric matrix so that H2@J is diagonalizable.
        Attention: A check if H2@J is diagonalizable is not done explicitly.
        
    T: matrix, optional
        Permutation matrix to change the ordering of canoncial
        coordinates and momenta, given here by default as (q1, ..., qn, p1, ..., pn), 
        into a different order. I.e. T transforms the 
        (n x n) block matrix

        into a matrix J' by matrix congruence: J' = T.transpose()@J@T.
        
    mode: str, optional
        Method of how to compute the symplectic matrices which conjugate-diagonalize H2.
        Supported modes are (default: 'default'):
        1) 'default' -- Use symplectic Takagi factorization
        2) 'classic' -- Use (unitary) Williamson diagonalization (works only if H2 is invertible.)
        
    check: boolean, optional
        Perform a consistency check whether H2@J is diagonalizable, using sympy.
        
    tol_logm: float, optional
        A tolerance to determine whether one or two exponentials are required for the map to normal form.
        Attention: A value of zero will result in two exponentials, which might not always be desired.
        For this reason the tolerance is set to a small value by default and a warning will be issued if
        two exponents have been found instead of one.
             
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary containing various linear maps. The items of this dictionary are described in the following.
        
        S      : The symplectic map diagonalizing H2 via S.transpose()@D@S = H2, where D is a diagonal matrix.
        Sinv   : The inverse of S, i.e. the symplectic map to (real) normal form.        
        H2     : The input in matrix form.
        T      : The (optional) matrix T described above.
        J      : The (original) symplectic structure J' = T.transpose()@J@T within which the input Hamiltonian was formulated.
                 Hereby J is the block-matrix from above.
        J2     : The new symplectic structure for the (xi, eta)-coordinates.
        U      : The unitary map from the S(q, p) = (u, v)-block coordinates to the (xi, eta)-coordinates.
        Uinv   : The inverse of U.
        K      : The linear map transforming (q, p) to (xi, eta)-coordinates. K is given by U@S@T.
        Kinv   : The inverse of K. Hence, it will transform H2 to complex normal form via Kinv.transpose()@H2@Kinv.
        rnf    : The 'real' normal form, by which we understand the diagonalization of H2 relative to the 
                 symplectic matrix S. Note that S might be complex if the Hesse matrix of H2 is not positive definite.
        cnf    : The 'complex' normal form, which is given as the representation of H2 in terms of the complex
                 normalizing (xi, eta)-coordinates (the 'new' complex symplectic structure).
        A      : A complex matrix transforming the underlying Hamiltonian H (whose Hesse-matrix corresponds to H2),
                 given in terms of complex (xi, eta)-coordinates, into normal form N via N = H o A.
                 It holds A = U@Sinv@Uinv. *Currently only returned for numpy input*
        S1, S2 : Elements of sp(2n; C) (the Lie-algebra of complex symplectic matrices) satisfying
                 A = exp(S1)@exp(S2). These matrices can be used to obtain respective polynomial representations
                 of the Lie-operator, mapping the given Hamiltonian H into its "first-order" normal form N (see
                 also the commment above). Note that if S1 or S2 does not exist, this means that the respective element is zero, so the element A can be repesented as a single exponential. The tolerance which
                 determines this behavior can be controlled with the tol_logm parameter. So if that parameter
                 is set to zero, there will always be returned two elements.
