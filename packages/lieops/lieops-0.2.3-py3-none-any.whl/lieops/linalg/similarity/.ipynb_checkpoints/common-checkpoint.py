def diagonal2block(D, code, tol=1e-10, **kwargs):
    r'''
    Computes a unitary map U which will diagonalize a matrix D of the form
    
       D = diag(a, b, ..., -a, ..., -b, ...)
       
    to a block matrix B = U.transpose().conjugate()@D@U of the form
    
        /  0   W  \
    B = |         |
        \ -W   0  /
    
    where W = diag(a*1j, b*1j, ...). The signs of a, b, ... can be controlled by an optional orientation (see below).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    D:
        A list of diagonal entries
        
    code:
        A code defining the matrix object output.
        
    tol: float, optional
        A small parameter to identify the pairs on the diagonal of D.
        
    tol_orientation: float, optional
        A small parameter to determine the orientation (used only if 'orientation' is provided).
        
    orientation: list, optional
        A list of expected eigenvalues. By default the orientation will be chosen according to the imaginary parts of D.
    
        Explanation:
        Giving an orientation may be necessary because the Jordan Normal Form (or diagonal form of a matrix) is only determined up to
        permuation of its blocks (here a pair of eigenvalues). Without any orientation this may result in inconsistent output, for example
        if a diagonal matrix is given as input in symplectic_takagi, symplectic_takagi calls this routine, and the output
        of symplectic_takagic then diagonalizes to a matrix in which the original order and signs of the input diagonal matrix
        have been changed (permuted or multiplied by a minus sign). To prevent this, one can provide a list of 'expected' eigenvalues here,
        which will therefore fix the correct order/orientation.
    
    Returns
    -------
    U:
        The unitary matrix described above.

def anti_diagonalize_real_skew(M, **kwargs):
    r'''
    Anti-diagonalize a real skew symmetric nxn-matrix M so that

    where X is a diagonal matrix with positive entries and R is an orthogonal matrix.
    
    Attention: No check is made if the given matrix has real coefficients or is skew symmetric.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    M:
        list of vectors defining a real skew symmetric (n x n)-matrix.

    **kwargs 
        Additional arguments are passed to .checks.relative_eq routine. Warning: If chosing 'mpmath' as code and dps value is
        set too small (corresponding to a too rough precision), then the tolerance 'tol' may have to be increased as well.
