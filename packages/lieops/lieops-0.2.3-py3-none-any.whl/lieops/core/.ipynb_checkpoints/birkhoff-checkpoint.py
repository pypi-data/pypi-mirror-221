    '''
    Let e[k], k = 1, ..., len(mu) be actions, H0 := sum_k mu[k]*e[k] and Z a

    Attention: No check whether Z is actually homogeneous or real, but if one of

    mu: list
        list of floats (tunes).

    '''
    Compute the Birkhoff normal form of a given Hamiltonian up to a specific order.
    
    Attention: Constants and any gradients of H at z will be ignored. If there is 
    a non-zero gradient, a warning is issued by default.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    H: callable or dict
        Defines the Hamiltonian to be normalized. 
        I) If H is callable, then a transformation to complex normal form is performed prior to
           applying the general algorithm.
        II) If H is a dictionary (e.g. from poly.items()), then its off-diagonal entries
            are ignored (so it is assumed that H has already been prepared to be in first-order
            normal form).
                
    order: int
        The order up to which we build the normal form. Here order = k means that we compute
        k homogeneous Lie-polynomials, where the smallest one will have power k + 2 and the 
        succeeding ones will have increased powers by 1.
    
    cmplx: boolean, optional
        If false, assume that the coefficients of the second-order terms of the Hamiltonian are real.
        In this case a check will be done and an error will be raised if that is not the case.
        
    tol_drop: float, optional
        Tolerance below which values in the Hamiltonian are set to zero.
        
    tol: float, optional
        Tolerance for consistency checks.
        
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments are passed to lieops.linalg.nf.first_order_nf_expansion routine.
        
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with the following keys:
        nfdict : The output of lieops.linalg.nf.first_order_nf_expansion.
        H_func : Callable denoting the Hamiltonian in (q, p)-coordinates whose derivatives will be calculated.
        H      : Dictionary denoting the Hamiltonian used at the start of the normal form procedure.
        H0     : Dictionary denoting the second-order coefficients of H.
        mu     : List of the tunes used (coefficients of H0).
        chi    : List of poly objects, denoting the Lie-polynomials of degree >= 3 which map to normal form.
        chi0   : List of the two Lie-polynomials of degree 2 which map the given Hamiltonian 
                 to its first-order normal form equivalent. This means that the list "chi0 + chi" performs the 
                 entire map up to the desired order (see also the example below). Not supported if mpmath has been used.                 
        Hk     : List of poly objects, corresponding to the transformed Hamiltonians.
        Zk     : List of poly objects, notation see Lem. 1.4.5. in Ref. [1]. 
        Qk     : List of poly objects, notation see Lem. 1.4.5. in Ref. [1].
        
    Example
    -------      
    nfdict = H1.bnf(order=4)
    w = H1.copy()
    for c in nfdict['chi0'] + nfdict['chi']:
        w = c.lexp(power=10)(w)
        print (w.above(1e-12)) # example
