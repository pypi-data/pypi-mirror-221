# Testudo

A wrapper for commands to be run as periodic tasks while reporting on their results/errors to legiond. Intended to be integrated with supervisord, should work well with systemd in theory.

## Setup & Usage

### Installation

`testudo` can be easily installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install testudo
```

### Configuration

TODO

### Usage

The key reference for using `testudo` is:

```bash
testudo --help
```

## Development

### Standards

- Be excellent to each other
- Code coverage must be at 100% for all new code, or a good reason must be provided for why a given bit of code is not covered.
  - Example of an acceptable reason: "There is a bug in the code coverage tool and it says its missing this, but its not".
  - Example of unacceptable reason: "This is just exception handling, its too annoying to cover it".
- The code must pass the following analytics tools. Similar exceptions are allowable as in rule 2.
  - `pylint --disable=C0103,C0111,W1203,R0903,R0913 --max-line-length=120 testudo`
  - `flake8 --max-line-length=120 ...`
  - `mypy --ignore-missing-imports --follow-imports=skip --strict-optional ...`
- All incoming information from users, clients, and configurations should be validated.
- All internal arguments passing should be typechecked whenever possible with `typeguard.typechecked`

### Development Setup

Using [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/) install from inside the repo directory:

```bash
pdm install
```

This will set up a virtualenv which you can always run specific commands with `pdm run ...`.

#### Development

### Testing

All testing should be done with `pytest` which is installed with the `--dev` requirements (`pdm --dev install ...`).

To run all the unit tests, execute the following from the repo directory:

```bash
pdm run pytest
```

This should produce a coverage report in `/path/to/dewey-api/htmlcov/`

While developing, you can use [`watchexec`](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) to monitor the file system for changes and re-run the tests:

```bash
watchexec -r -e py,yaml pdm run pytest
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
pdm run pytest tests/unit/test_cli.py
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
pdm run pytest tests/unit/test_cli.py::test_cli_basics
```

For more information on testing, see the `pytest.ini` file as well as the [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
