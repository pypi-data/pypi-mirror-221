= data-chunker

Python library that chunks code into a Python list consisting of Python dictionaries. This list of dictionaries can then be used for vector-store creation, which can provide granular context for OpenAI queries.

Current list of languages that can be chunked:

* Java (packages, methods, and variables)

== Modules
=== parser.py
* Contains functions to read code lines from given files and file paths
* get_file_list(code_path, file_extension) - returns a list of files from the path passed in
* get_code_lines(file) - returns the code from the file name passed in

=== java_code.py
* Contains functions to split java files into smaller chunks

== Contributing

The GitHub repository for this package is https://github.com/break-free/data-chunker.

The `main` branch is protected therefore any contributions require a branch to be created. Branch names should be preprended with either `feat/` or `fix/` to indicate whether new functionality or a refactor/fix is being made (e.g, `fix/update-readme`). Once the branch is complete, it can be merged back into `main`.

The repository includes additional directories, such as `setup`, `info`, and `training`, and files such as `main.py`, that includes additional resources for development and usage examples.
