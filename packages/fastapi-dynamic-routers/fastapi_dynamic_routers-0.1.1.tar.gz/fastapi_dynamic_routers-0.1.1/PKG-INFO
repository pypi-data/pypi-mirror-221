fastapi_dynamic_routers is a Python library that simplifies the management of routes in FastAPI applications. It provides a clean and efficient way to register routes dynamically, enabling you to keep your codebase organized and maintainable, even as your application grows.

Key Features:
- Simplicity: The library comes with a straightforward implementation that seamlessly integrates with your FastAPI application.
- Ease of Use: With just a few lines of code, you can include or exclude routes from your application, providing the flexibility you need during development.
- Organized Codebase: By dynamically registering routes, you can maintain a clean and well-structured codebase, even in large-scale projects.

Usage Example:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_dynamic_routers import Routers

app = FastAPI()

# List of router modules to include dynamically
URLS = [
    'path.to.APIRouter.instantiate',
    '...'
]

# Initialize the dynamic routers
routers = Routers(app, URLS)()
```

In this example, simply modify the `URLS` list to add or remove routes from your FastAPI application. The dynamic routes includer will handle the registration, keeping your main file clean and focused.
