# Social Finance Data Pipeline

This is a package that aims to standerdise one or more datasets against a defined schema.
It is currently in it's very early stagies.

check the [wiki](https://github.com/SocialFinanceDigitalLabs/sfdata/wiki) for more details on the plan.


## Current status

Current the pipeline only works with xml files and is limited to one schema and one file.
It's a first generic approach, that was tested against CIN and SWWF datasets.

## How to run

Check the [demo.py](./demo.py) file. It has 2 functions that run against the CIN and SWWF datasets present in the [samples](./samples/) directory.

There's also smaller samples of those datasets.
