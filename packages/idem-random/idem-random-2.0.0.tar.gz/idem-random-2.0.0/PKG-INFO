An Idem plugin that provides randomness.

About
=====
Idem Random provides us with logical states like random password,
random integer, random string which can be used in conjunction with
other idem plugins. This plugin in itself doesn't interact with the
any cloud provider.

An example use-case where this plugin can be used is -
AWS RDS database instance needs a password when its created.
We can use AWS's RDS state along with Idem random password state
in order to generate a random password at runtime and help create
the RDS instance.


Random ID
------------
The resource random_id generates random numbers that are intended to be used as unique identifiers for other resources.
This resource does use a cryptographic random number generator in order to minimize the chance of collisions, making the
results of this resource when a 16-byte identifier is requested of equivalent uniqueness to a type-4 UUID.

What is POP?
------------

This project is built with `pop <https://pop.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-based
implementation of *Plugin Oriented Programming (POP)*. POP seeks to bring
together concepts and wisdom from the history of computing in new ways to solve
modern computing problems.
