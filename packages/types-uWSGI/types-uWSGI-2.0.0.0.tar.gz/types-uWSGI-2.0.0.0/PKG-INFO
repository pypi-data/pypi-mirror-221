## Typing stubs for uWSGI

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `uWSGI` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`uWSGI`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/uWSGI. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Type hints for uWSGI's [Python API](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonModule.html). Note that this API is available only when running Python code inside a uWSGI process and some parts of the API are only present when corresponding configuration options have been enabled.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `21cb2cb546e1bd120091d6fe7087c847e0297d39` and was tested
with mypy 1.4.1, pyright 1.1.318, and
pytype 2023.7.21.
