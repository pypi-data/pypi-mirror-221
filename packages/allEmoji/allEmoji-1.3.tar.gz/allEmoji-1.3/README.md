# allEmoji

## Simply use emojies as class attributes in Python

This is just one of my hobby projects. Nothing much useful for others
So, if you're using VS-Code or any other editors that gives you the attribute suggestions, then it'll come to your use. Else, use the `emoji` library that's more advanced.

```
pip install allEmoji
```
