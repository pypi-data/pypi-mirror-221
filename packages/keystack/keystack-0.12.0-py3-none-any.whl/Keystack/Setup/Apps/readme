- Every module folder that you create must have a plugin module
  to run your module.

- Each plugin module must have the prefix "plugin_" in front of your Module name.

- The plugin module file name must be spelled exactly how you spelled your
  Module's folder.  If you rename your Module's folder, you must rename
  the plugin module.

- The main app will call the plugin module and pass in the main self object 
  so the plugin module has access to all the envParams such as all the env IP addresses,
  playbook details and testcase details

- The plugin_CustomPythonScripts.py module runs plain vanilla Python scripts.
  This is the only plugin that will not have access to envParams because
  plain vanilla Python scripts has no code logics to take in the self object.
