# EfficientSceneDetector
A python package for detecting scenes from a video using audio features.
The generated scenes should be with different context.
## Quick Start
```
from EfficientSceneDetector.sceneDetection import SceneDetection
objScene = SceneDetection()
objScene.detect_scenes("input_video.mp4", 4, "True")
```
#### Details
* input_video.mp4 : your input video path.
* 4 : size of window to be considered while generating scenes. If window is large then large scenes could be generated. If the window size is small then small scenes could be generated
* "True" : If you want to save generated scenes using ffmpeg. Make it "False" if you don't want to generate the scenes.

#### Output
* You will get all the scenes, and a csv file in the "Scenes" folder.
* The csv file columns are : SceneNumber, StartTime (Seconds), StartTime (TimeStamp), EndTime (Seconds), EndTime (TimeStamp) and Path

#### CSV Columns
* SceneNumber : Number of scenes, starting from 1.
* StartTime (Seconds) : Start time of a scene in seconds.
* StartTime (TimeStamp) : Start time of a scene in "%d:%02d:%02d" format.
* EndTime (Seconds) : End time of a scene in seconds.
* EndTime (TimeStamp) : End time of a scene in "%d:%02d:%02d" format.
* Path : Path of generated scenes.
