Tutorials & Examples

The tutorials will lead you through creating remote control software for your own robot.

Each tutorial builds upon the previous one's code, so it is important to go in order.

The full code for each of the tutorials can be seen in the `examples directory <https://github.com/dkumor/rtcbot/tree/master/examples>`_.
