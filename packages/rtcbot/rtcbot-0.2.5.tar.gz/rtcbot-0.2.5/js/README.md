RTCBot's purpose is to provide a set of tutorials and simple modules that help in developing remote-controlled robots in Python, with a focus on the Raspberry Pi.

This is the javascript component of the RTCBot python library, allowing for connecting to and streaming between a browser and Python.

While the library was built for interoperability with Python, it can be used standalone for a simplified interface to WebRTC.

Please [Visit the documentation](https://rtcbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.
