class ShellServer:
    r"""
    Shell Server: A simple server-side application that allows multiple clients to connect, execute shell-like commands,
    taking screenshots, and exchange files over a network using sockets.

    To install the client: https://pypi.org/project/reverseshellclient/

    This server application implements a basic command shell that listens for client connections, executes user commands,
    and responds to the client with appropriate outputs or actions.
    Clients can connect to the server using a TCP/IP socket

    The server and client communicate using a custom command encoding format to handle large data transmissions.
    The server can send data to the client, and the client can send data to the server.


    Usage:
    1. Instantiate the ShellServer class with desired configurations (port, buffer size, commands, etc.).
    2. Start the server using the `do_actions()` method, which listens for incoming client connections and allows communication with clients.
    3. Clients can connect to the server using a TCP/IP socket.

    Note:
    - The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously through multi-threading.
    - When a client sends the 'quit' command, the client remains connected.
    - When a client sends the 'exit' command, the client is disconnected from the server.
    - The server supports the 'putfile' and 'getfile' commands to send and receive files between the server and clients.

    Example usage:
    from reverseshellserver import ShellServer
    se = ShellServer(
        port=12345,
        listen=5,
        byte_len=32768,
        command_quit="quit",
        command_disconnect="disconnect",
        command_exit="exit",
        command_putfile="putfile",
        command_getfile="getfile",
        command_screenshot="screenshot",
        command_getcwd="getcwd",
        command_putfile_sep=b"FILESEP",
        command_start=b"START_START_START",
        command_end=b"END_END_END",
    )
    se.do_actions()

        Initialize the ShellServer object with the specified configurations.

        Parameters:
            port (int): The port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections.
            listen (int): The maximum number of queued connections to allow (backlog) while the server is busy.
            byte_len (int): The maximum size of each data chunk (in bytes) used for communication with clients.
            command_quit (str): The command that switches back to the client selection.
            command_exit (str): The command that closes the server.
            command_disconnect (str): The command that disconnects a client from the server.
            command_putfile (str): The command prefix used to indicate a request from the server to send a file to the client.
            command_getfile (str): The command prefix used to indicate a request from the server to receive a file from the client.
            command_screenshot (str): The command that, when sent by a server, requests the client to take a screenshot and send it back as an image file.
            command_getcwd (str): The command that, when sent by a server, requests the client to send the current working directory path.
            command_putfile_sep (bytes): The separator used to split the 'putfile' command and the filename along with the file content.
            command_start (bytes): The marker used to indicate the start of a command transmission.
            command_end (bytes): The marker used to indicate the end of a command transmission.

        Note:
            - 'command_quit', 'command_exit', and 'command_disconnect' serve different purposes in controlling the client-server interaction.
            - The 'command_putfile', 'command_getfile', 'command_screenshot', and 'command_getcwd' prefixes are used for specific actions from the server.
            - The 'command_putfile_sep' is used to split the 'putfile' command and the filename along with the file content.
            - 'command_start' and 'command_end' are used to wrap the encoded command for large data transmissions.
            - The server starts listening for incoming client connections in a separate thread when this object is initialized.
