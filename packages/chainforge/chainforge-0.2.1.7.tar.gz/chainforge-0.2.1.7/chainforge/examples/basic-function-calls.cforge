As the warm air rises, it cools and forms cumulonimbus clouds, which are the towering dark clouds that typically come to mind when thinking of a thunderstorm. Within these clouds, a variety of atmospheric conditions exist that can cause the development of lightning, thunder, heavy rain, hail, and tornadoes. The exact cause of a thunderstorm can vary depending on the location, time of year, and other environmental factors."
