# ephemeral-sh

A one-task tracker in your terminal with a forgetful history.

`Ephemeral` keeps track of a single task, and when it was started. Once you decide to track something new, the old task is forgotten.

- See your current task: `ephemeral`
- Track a new task: `ephemeral track`
- Clear your history: `ephemeral clear`
