"""
_sink.py:

This file contains all of the classes used for constructing and interacting with `Sink` objects.

Classes:
    - `SinkDoesNotExistError` - Error raised when attempting to access a sink which does not exist.
    - `Sink` - Abstract base class from which all sinks must inherit.
    - `SyncSink` - Class used for blocking/synchronous logging.
