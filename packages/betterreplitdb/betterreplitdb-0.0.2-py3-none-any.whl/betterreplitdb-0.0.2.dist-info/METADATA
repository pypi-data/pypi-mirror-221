# Better Replit DB (Python)

*Adds a memcache to the standard replit database*

To perform database operations such as reading, writing and deleting data, the official `replit` package simply sends the corresponding request to your REPL's database URL. However, this can be made more efficient by caching the database in RAM using a python dictionary, initialized when the database is created/when the REPL starts. For `AsyncDatabase`, read operations read from the cache and update/delete operations will update the cache, then perform the action asynchronously as before. The same occurs for the synchronous `Database` but with regular/synchronous update operations.

## Usage

### Async:

Replace

``` python
from replit.database import AsyncDatabase

async_db = AsyncDatabase(replit_db_url)
```

with

``` python
from betterreplitdb import AsyncDatabase

async_db = AsyncDatabase(replit_db_url)
async_db.init_cache()
```
*Note: Replit's [docs](https://replit-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/db_tutorial.html#async-usage) say that you need to use AsyncDatabase() to construct a DB. This is false, please use `AsyncDatabase(environ["REPLIT_DB_URL"])` instead, where environ is `os.environ`.*


### Sync:

Replace

``` python
from replit import db
```

with

``` python
from betterreplitdb import db
```
