Gaia calculator for White Dwarfs

Gaia is a space observatory of the European Space Agency (ESA). The mission aims to construct the largest and most precise 3D space catalog.
EDR3 - Early Data Release 3 - was released on 3 December 2020.
DR3 - 3rd data release - was released on 13 June 2022.
Those catalogs include 1811709771 objects. Data is freely downloadable from ESA servers.
The DR3 database contains more than 200 parameters for each space object.

The Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya · BarcelonaTech (UPC) makes available a tool to compute the mass and temperature of White Dwarfs stars. This tool is based on data abacus, spatial index, and interpolation.

Any input file with CSV format is accepted, provided that is contains at least 3 columns with values for BP-RP, Gabs and probability.
The tool will add 2 more columns with mass and Teff of the star.

The tool is available as :
- online access here : http://gaia.doligez.fr
- MacOS application
- Windows exe file
- Python package
- linux debian package
- GitHub source code

See PACKAGING.txt to be able to generate any or all of these deliveries from the source code.
