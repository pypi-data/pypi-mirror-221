The fields that control the behavior of the quantum matter machine are contained as *values* in the *inputs* list ([]).  For now, we will only discuss cases where the *inputs* list contains a single element.  When this list's length is greater than one, it signifies a so-called *batch* job, which will be discussed in a later walkthrough.  \n",

These primitives include *rf_evaporation*, *optical_barriers*, *optical_landscape*, and *lasers*.  Much like an *OqtantJob* itself, these constituent primitives are programmatic objects in their own right and can be instantiated and manipulated outside of a job object.  Although not shown explicitly in our simple job data structure above, both *optical_barriers* and *lasers* are lists containing *Barrier* and *Laser* objects, respectively.  These objects will be explored below.  You are likely already familiar with the structure of the *rf_evaporation* data and how defining that data controls the evaporation to BEC in the experiment.

The behavior of this object controls the RF knife evaporation from an ultracold gas to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), as well as providing flexibility for applying RF fields during the experiment phase after the initial evaporation is complete.  The evaporation stage results in a tradeoff between final atom number and temperature -- evaporating more deeply, signified by RF detuning values closer to 0, produces less atoms but at colder temperature (and correspondingly higher condensate fraction).  Applying RF radiation during the experiment phase allows for hot atoms above some temperature, produced for example by rapid manipulation of optical barries or landscape potentials (explored below), to be removed the experiment -- a so-called \"RF shield\". \n",

In this case, we specify a list of times in milliseconds (ms), frequencies in MHz (mhz), and powers in milliwatts (mw).  Note that all units are lower case, which can cause confusion if taken out of context.  All three lists must share the same length as each time element is paired with the corresponding element of the frequencies/powers list(s).  The specified behavior of the RF evaporation stage defind by the above data is as follows: At -1.6 seconds the RF power is set at 500 mW and the frequency (detuning) at 17 MHz.  By the end of the evaporation period, defined by t=0, the frequency/detuning has decreased to 0.045 MHz = 45 kHz and the power has been reduced to 220 mW.  Intermediate values of frequency and power are adopted between those two points in time, with the full time dependence being a result of the given data and chosen interpolation type, which controls how the RF fields behave between the given data points.      \n",

Powers refer to the amount of power delivered to an antenna that bathes the ultracold atoms with RF radiation.  The actual local RF field experienced by the atoms depends on system losses and the exact geometry of the antenna.      "

    "The time-dependence of the overall optical potential-energy landscape, as derived from the individual *landscapes[]* list, is somewhat complicated.  As for *Barrier* and other similar objects, any temporal extrapolation (behavior for data outside the defined time period, i.e. before the first or after the last elements of the *landscapes[]* list) results in zero potential  (in the absence of any other sources, such as Barriers).  Therefore, the only way to get a non-zero painted potential optical landscape is to define at least two landscapes that can be interpolated between.  To hold a static (unchanging) potential during a period of the experiment, one would define two elements of the *landscapes[]* list with identical potential energy profiles but differing times, with the potential being applied between those two times.  If one desires the potential to change dynamically, then adjacent elements of the *landscapes[]* list (elements with the nearest *time_ms* values) should define the snapshots of the desired potential at the temporal endpoints.  In between these endpoints the potential landscape is interpolated point-by-point (in position) according to the user-specified value for *interpolation*.  This process continues so that, at the specified times of the elements of *landscapes[]*, the overall optical potential energy landscape instantaneously equal to those individual landscapes.  \n",
