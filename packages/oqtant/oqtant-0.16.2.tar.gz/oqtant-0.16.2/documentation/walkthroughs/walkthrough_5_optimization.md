# Oqtant Walkthrough 5: Ultracold Matter Optimization

### This walkthrough covers optimization of Ultracold Matter OqtantJobs.

For more information about Oqtant refer to our documentation: https://gitlab.com/infleqtion/albert/oqtant/-/blob/main/README.md

_Batch job functionality is available for users with a subscription tier of EXPLORER or INNOVATOR._

`get_user_token` creates a temporary web server on your machine to handle authenticating with Oraqle. By default this server will run on port 8080, if that port is unavailable you can edit the `get_user_token` default port `token = get_user_token(auth_server_port=8080)` with one of the following: 8081, 8082, 8083, 8084, 8085.

# Authenticate with Oraqle

## Before you can view and submit OqtantJobs you must first authenticate with your Oraqle account

Run the below cell to be re-directed to our login page and provide your account credentials. Once authenticated you can safely close out that tab and return to this notebook.

```python
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor as GPR
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from warnings import catch_warnings
from warnings import simplefilter
from scipy.stats import norm
from lmfit import Model
import numpy as np
import inspect
import copy
from oqtant.oqtant_client import get_oqtant_client
from oqtant.util.auth import get_user_token
from bert_schemas import job as JobSchema
from oqtant.schemas.job import (
    OqtantJob,
    Gaussian_dist_2D,
    TF_dist_2D,
    bimodal_dist_2D,
    round_sig,
)
import csv

token = get_user_token(auth_server_port=8080)
```

## Creating a OqtantClient Instance

### After successfully logging in, create an authorized session with the OqtantClient

- The OqtantClient class interacts with the Oraqle server to perform remote lab functions.
- The OqtantClient object also contains all the OqtantJobs which have been submitted, run, or loaded (from database or file) during this python session

```python
oqtant_client = get_oqtant_client(token)
```

## Define a cost function for optimization

A cost function is a metric calculated for the system of interest which is lowered over time via some optimization script

Larger value = Good: Condensed and total atom number, condensate fraction
Smaller value = Good: Thermal atom number, temperature

Ad hoc Cost function: **C = (Nth\*T)/Nc**

### cost_func_5D

This cost function is for a 5-dimensional optimization space, where the 5 dimensions are the RF corner frequencies.

```python
costs_5D = []

base_ultracold_matter_job = {
    "name": "Example Ultracold Matter Generator Job",
    "job_type": "BEC",
    "inputs": [
        {
            "values": {
                "time_of_flight_ms": 8.0,
                "image_type": "TIME_OF_FLIGHT",
                "end_time_ms": 0.0,
                "rf_evaporation": {
                    "frequencies_mhz": [17.0, 8.0, 4.0, 1.2, 0.045],
                    "powers_mw": [500.0, 500.0, 475.0, 360.0, 220.0],
                    "interpolation": "LINEAR",
                    "times_ms": [-1600, -1200, -800, -400, 0],
                },
                "optical_barriers": None,
                "optical_landscape": None,
                "lasers": None,
            },
        }
    ],
}


def cost_func_5D(RF_freqs=[17.0, 8.0, 4.0, 1.2, 0.045]):  # added 5th power to default
    base_ultracold_matter_job["inputs"][0]["values"]["rf_evaporation"][
        "frequencies_mhz"
    ] = list(RF_freqs)
    print(base_ultracold_matter_job)
    job = oqtant_client.generate_oqtant_job(job=base_ultracold_matter_job)
    [job_id] = oqtant_client.run_jobs(job_list=[job], track_status=True)
    job_output = oqtant_client.active_jobs[job_id].inputs[0].output.values
    Nth = job_output.thermal_atom_number
    T = job_output.temperature_uk
    Nc = job_output.condensed_atom_number
    C = (Nth * T) / Nc
    costs_5D.append(C)
    return C
```

## Set bounds for optimization

Bounds will prevent invalid jobs parameters from being submitted to the Oraqle.

```python
bnds_5d = ((0, 50), (0, 50), (0, 50), (0, 50), (0, 50))
```

## Choose an optimization algorithm

Here, I chose a truncated Newton method (TNC). TNC uses a truncated Newton algorithm to minimize a function with variables subject to bounds. Within scipy.optimize.minimize there are several options for optimizers which allow for bounded variables:

- L-BFGS-B
- TNC
- COBYLA
- SLSQP

## Provide initial conditions and max iterations

I chose the Oraqle web application's default parameters for a mixed cloud for the x0 initial conditions. Specify iterations with **options={'maxiter':10}**. Note that each iteration may involve several evaluations of the cost function (which means several jobs), so setting **'maxiter':30** will not run within a single 24 hour period.

```python
res_5d = minimize(
    cost_func_5D,
    method="TNC",
    bounds=bnds_5d,
    x0=[17, 8, 4, 1.2, 0.05],
    options={"maxiter": 10},
)

print("optimization results freq tuning:")
print(res_5d)
```

## Bayesian Optimization with a Gaussian Process model

## Extract and shape the training data:

x_train : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or list of object
Feature vectors or other representations of training data (also required for prediction).

y_train : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)
Target values in training data (also required for prediction)

## Define a new target cost function

```python
def cost(Nc, Nth, T):
    C = (Nth * T) / Nc
    return C
```

The optimization jobs run above will now be included in your list of currently active OqtantJobs:

```python
oqtant_client.see_active_jobs()
```

```python
x_train = []
y_train = []
for job_id in oqtant_client.active_jobs:
    job = oqtant_client.active_jobs[job_id]
    output = job.inputs[0].output.values
    condensed_atom_number = output.condensed_atom_number
    thermal_atom_number = output.thermal_atom_number
    temperature_uk = output.temperature_uk
    input = job.inputs[0].values
    x_train.append(input.rf_evaporation.frequencies_mhz)
    y_train.append(cost(condensed_atom_number, thermal_atom_number, temperature_uk))
```

```python
# surrogate or approximation for the objective function
def surrogate(model, X):
    # catch any warning generated when making a prediction
    with catch_warnings():
        # ignore generated warnings
        simplefilter("ignore")
        return model.predict(X, return_std=True)
```

## Define an acquisition function

This is a score assigned to each candidate sample on the domain.

The surrogate function can be used as an acquisition (minimizing the surrogate is the goal after all)

OR

An acquisition function can be used. 3 common options:

- Probability of Improvement (PI).
- Expected Improvement (EI).
- Lower Confidence Bound (LCB).

Here I chose probability of improvement

**PI = cdf((mu â€“ best_mu) / stdev)**

Where PI is the probability of improvement, cdf() is the normal cumulative distribution function, mu is the mean of the surrogate function for a given sample x, stdev is the standard deviation of the surrogate function for a given sample x, and best_mu is the mean of the surrogate function for the best sample found so far.

```python
def acquisition(X, Xsamples, model):
    # calculate the best surrogate score found so far
    yhat, _ = surrogate(model, X)
    best = max(yhat)
    # calculate mean and stdev via surrogate function
    mu, std = surrogate(model, Xsamples)
    # mu = mu[:, 0]
    # calculate the probability of improvement
    probs = norm.cdf((mu - best) / (std + 1e-9))
    return probs
```

## Define a domain

This is the domain of the samples. This one point where we inject prior knowledge of the system from previous experience

```python
domain = [
    (20.0, 15.0),
    (12.0, 5.0),
    (5.0, 2.0),
    (1.9, 0.2),
    (0.2, 0.01),
    (500.0, 470.0),
    (470.0, 460.0),
    (459.0, 420.0),
    (420.0, 350.0),
]


def rand_domain_sample(domain):
    scale = domain[0] - domain[1]
    random_number = np.random.uniform() + (1e-9)
    sample = scale * random_number + domain[1]
    return sample
```

## Define an optimizer on the acquisition function

Here I have chosen a random search over the domain, but other search algorithms can be used.

```python
def optimize_acquisition(X, y, model, sample_population):
    # random search, generate random samples
    Xsamples = np.asarray(
        [
            [rand_domain_sample(domain[i]) for i in range(len(X[0]))]
            for j in range(sample_population)
        ]
    )
    Xsamples = Xsamples.reshape(len(Xsamples), len(X[0]))
    # calculate the acquisition function for each sample
    scores = acquisition(X, Xsamples, model)
    # locate the index of the largest scores
    ix = np.argmax(scores)
    return Xsamples[ix]
```

## Perform the optimization

```python
X = x_train
Y = y_train
Oqtant_model = GPR()
Oqtant_model.fit(x_train, y_train)

cost = []

for i in range(10):
    # select the next point to sample
    x = optimize_acquisition(X, Y, Oqtant_model, 500)
    print("x", x)
    # sample the point
    actual = cost_func_5D(x)
    cost.append(actual)
    # summarize the finding
    est, _ = surrogate(Oqtant_model, [x])
    print(x, est, actual)
    # add the data to the dataset
    X = np.vstack((X, [x]))
    Y.append(actual)
    # update the model
    Oqtant_model.fit(X, Y)
```

```python
# plot all samples and the final surrogate function
plt.plot(cost[5:])
# plt.yscale("log")
plt.xlabel("function evaluations")
plt.ylabel("Cost")
plt.title("20 evaluations, 500 surrogate samples, 335pm 5_5_21")
plt.savefig("335pm 5_5_21.png")
plt.show()
# best result
ix = np.argmax(Y)
print("Best Result:" + str([X[ix], Y[ix]]))
```
