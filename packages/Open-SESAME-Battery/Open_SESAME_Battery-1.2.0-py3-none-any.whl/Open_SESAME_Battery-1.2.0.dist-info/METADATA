# Open-SESAME-Battery

Open-SESAME-Battery is an open source battery lifetime simulation software developed by Bern University of Applied
Science (BFH) with contributions of Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM) within the framework of the
IEA task 32 funded by Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE).

## Structure

This project is structured in three different folders:

- doc
- src
- tests

In the doc folder you will find a user-guide pdf of this project.
The src (source) folder contains the main package that contains all scripts and data tables for the simulation.
The folder tests contains testing-scripts and some test input data.

On top level of the project-folder you will find the "app-demo.py" and "app-demo_SoC.py" Scripts.
Both are Demo-Scripts of how to define a simulation and run it.
Check the Get started chapter for more information.

## Get started

To run the simulation some preparations have to be done.

1. Read the file `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`.
2. Execute the `app-demo.py` file to test the simulation a first time
3. If everything was successful you can now use the simulation for your project

Consult the `user-guide.pdf` in the doc folder of the repository on gitlab.
You can include open-sesame as repository of your project and initialize the simulation on your own or you can also
adapt `app-demo.py` to your needs and run this script for your simulations.
