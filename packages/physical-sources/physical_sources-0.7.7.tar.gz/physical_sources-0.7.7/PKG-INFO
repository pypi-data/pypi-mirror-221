This is a collection of classes meant to provide access to acoustic source levels that were contained within the initial
release of the Counter Listener Acoustic Warfare Software (CLAWS). But with the changes to the releasibility of the code
and data from CLAWS, a number of classes were removed from the distribution. 





# 2023
## May
+ Creation of the package
+ Added functions for the plotting of the surface
+ Moved functions for calculating the harmonic series expansion from separate classes to functions in the harmonic series representation

## June
+ Updated the class for reading the EEG data to obtain a Waveform object from the selected channel within the listing
+ Refactored the HarmonicSeries class to inherit from the ISphereSource interface.

## July
+ Removed the EEG structure from the physical sources as many of the information that we are interested in exploring exists within MNE.
+ Increased version
+ Restructured the package to facilitate better inheritance and class structure, and increased the versioning. This included moving the data from the tests and the sources to new folder structure that assists with the definition of specific types of source definitions.
+ Significant updates to the restructuring of the code
+ added a UML diagram for the package to the README.md file
