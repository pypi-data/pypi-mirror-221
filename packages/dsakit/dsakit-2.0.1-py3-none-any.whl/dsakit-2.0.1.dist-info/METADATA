## Overview

DSA Kit is a comprehensive collection of Python modules that implement various data structures and algorithms from scratch. The primary goal of this project is to provide efficient and well-optimized implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Developed all data structures as Python modules using best-known algorithms.
- Ensured efficient Time and Space complexities for all implemented algorithms.
- Comprehensive modules for Linked Lists, Binary Trees, and Tries with essential functions not available in Python's standard library.
- Implemented default data structures like HashSet, HashMap, Circular Deque, and Min/Max Heap.

```bash
pip install dsakit
```
OR
```bash
pip3 install dsakit
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use any of the 4 modules of this package:
- LinkedList
- BinaryTree
- Trie
- UnionFind,
using the following import on python

```python
from LinkedList import *
from BinaryTree import *
from Trie import *
from UnionFind import *
```
