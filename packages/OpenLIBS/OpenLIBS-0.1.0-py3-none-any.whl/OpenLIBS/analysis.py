    """
    This function compares a list of peaks in a spectrum to the standard peaks for an element in a CSV file database.

    The CSV files are named after their corresponding elements, and the function checks the file corresponding to the
    required element.

    The CSV file contains 3 columns - Persistence, Wavelength, and Ionization_State.

    If only persistent peaks are to be checked then we only select those rows with the line_type being 'P'

    A peak is considered a match if its wavelength falls within a certain error range of the standard peak wavelength,
    determined by `lower_error` and `upper_error`. i.e. a peak is considered a match if,
    (standard_peak - lower_error) <= peak_value <= (standard_peak + upper_error)

    Here lower_error is also positive as it represents the magnitude of error allowed in the negative direction.
    A negative lower error would mean that the region to be checked is on the right side of the standard peak.

    When looking at a Spectrum, which is not ideal, the peaks would be shifted toward one direction and hence using an
    error system where symmetrical error is checked about the actual data would not work. Hence, we need a system which
    would allow us to set an interval of error within which the difference should lie for it to be a match.

    If the number of matched peaks for the element exceeds `match_threshold`, Then it is a successful match.

    Additionally, a list of all matched peaks(if any) and its details is returned.

    :param peak_data: A 2D array with the first column representing the wavelength (nm) and the second column
                      representing the intensity of peaks in the spectrum to be compared.
    :param element: The name (Atomic name) of the element to be compared.
    :param line_type: The type of standard line 'P' or 'S' to be checked. (P is a subset of S)
    :param lower_error: The difference in wavelength (nm) allowed to the left of the standard peak for a peak to be
                        considered a match.
    :param upper_error: The difference in wavelength (nm) allowed to the right of the standard peak for a peak to be
                        considered a match.
    :param match_threshold: The minimum number of peaks that must match the standard peaks for an element to be
                            considered a match.

    :return: A bool value of whether the element is a match, and a list of matching peaks, their intensities, and the
             standard peak they matched with.
