"""
The `solver` package contains the following main objects:

* :py:class:`CfgSetup`: read a configuration file and set all simulation parameters.
* :py:class:`FDTD`: setup and run the FDTD simulation
* :py:class:`Pulse`: Describes an initial gaussian pressure pulse condition
* :py:class:`Monopole`: Describes a time evolving source


 The following example gives the general philosophy to use **nsfds3**::

   from nsfds3.solver import CfgSetup, FDTD
   from nsfds3.cpgrid import build_mesh

   # Initialize simulation parameter
   cfg = CfgSetup()    # or cfg = CfgSetup('path_to_configfile.conf')

   # Define the mesh
   msh = build_mesh(cfg)

   # Create and run simulation
   fdtd = FDTD(msh, cfg)
   fdtd.run()

   # Figures
   fdtd.show(view='p', nans=True, buffer=True, grid=False, obstacles=True)
