# A lightweight library for Connecting to Google Cloud Run Endpoints
This is a lightweight library for making authenticated calls to Cloud Run endpoints with Python clients.

## Usage
Before you can use this project, you need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.
On Unix-based systems (like Linux and MacOS), you can install Poetry using this command:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

- To run tests, from `python-client/alis/build`
    - ```python -m unittest discover test```
- To install the package locally: ```poetry install```
- To build the package: ```poetry build```
- To publish the package:
    - Ensure the relevant version is set in `pyproject.toml`
    - Populate dist/ by building the package from source
    - Set up ~/.pypirc
    ```
    [pypi]
        username = __token__
        password = <API_KEY>
    ```
    - Publish dist/ with twine, from `python-client`
        - ```pip install twine```
        - ```twine upload -r pypi dist/*```
