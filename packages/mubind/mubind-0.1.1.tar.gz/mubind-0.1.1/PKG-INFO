## Model highlights

- Mubind is a machine learning method for learning motif associations with single cell genomics data, using graph representations such as a k-nearest neighbors graph (kNN).
- It uses sample-sample operation (graphs) to communicate filter activities (learned motifs) across cells.
- The whole codebase is written in PyTorch.
- This package works with single-cell genomics data, scATAC-seq, scChIP-seq, etc. We have also tested it on bulk in vitro samples (HT-SELEX, PBM). Please see the documentation for related examples.

## Scalability

- Number of cells: The scalability of this method has been tested on single-cell datasets between 10,000 and 100,000 cells.
- Number of peaks: We have tested randomly selected features, or EpiScanpy's [variability score](https://episcanpy.readthedocs.io/en/anna/api/episcanpy.pp.select_var_feature.html). Modeling all features requires calibration of batch sizes and total GPU memory.
- Usual running times (one GPU): We get variable running times based on hyper-parameters, and they range between 10 minutes (prior filters) and 3 hours (de novo).
