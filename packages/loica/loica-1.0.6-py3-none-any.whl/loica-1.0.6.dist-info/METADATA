## Installation

Installing LOICA is way easier than pronuncing it! 

Do:

`pip install loica`

For more details please refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/RudgeLab/LOICA/wiki) for installation instructions and developer guides.

## LOICA allows you to:

- Compile Code into DNA fragments that execute Cell Algorithms
- Easy programation of genetic network models
- Generation of synthetic data
- Communicate with Flapjack
- Use and output SBOL files
- Use all sorts of cellular computation
- Easy, fluid and customisable DNA design

## Documentation

 Please visit our documentation with API reference at Read the Docs [loica.rtfd.io](https://loica.rtfd.io)

## Tutorials

Now that you have LOICA installed you can familiarize yourself with the tool using the [Jupyter notebook tutorials](https://github.com/RudgeLab/LOICA/tree/master/notebooks) designed for this purpose.

Run LOICA on the web without any installation! [LOICA Colab Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xxxMS5amaTGY2Z09i5h03zMr2J2zGiwg/view?usp=sharing)
