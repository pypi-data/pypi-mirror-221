# Django Migration Rollback v1.0.5
A Django package used to just make the `python manage.py migrate` a little easier for Django apps that commit their migrations and want a way to rollback to a previous migration without needing to check what the which one it is via `python manage.py showmigrations` or in the project's git repository.

## Features
Able to set which branch in a git repository to rollback to using the custom command `migraterollback` or if you wish to just rollback to a previous migration only via `migrateprevious`. Note in order to use the rollback with a git repository's branch feature with git the project must have a `.git` file present.

### Django `migraterollback` command
    ❯ python manage.py migraterollback polls feature/really-cool-branch
    Attempting to go back to rollback polls to latest migration on branch feature/really-cool-branch
    Operations to perform:
        Target specific migration: 0006_question5, from polls
    Running migrations:
        Rendering model states...
    DONE
        Unapplying polls.0007_question6...
    OK

This command is used to migrate a Django app back to the migration found in a repository's branch (this will also migrate to that migration if behind).

* An app must be specified as the first argument after the command to indicate which app you wish to rollback.
* By default if no argument is specified after the app, the branch `main` will be used.

### Django `migrateprevious` command
    ❯ python manage.py migrateprevious polls
    Attempting to go back to rollback polls to previous migration
    Operations to perform:
        Target specific migration: 0005_question4, from polls
    Running migrations:
        Rendering model states...
    DONE
        Unapplying polls.0006_question5...
    OK

This command is used to migrate a Django app back to the previously applied migration.

* An app must be specified as the first argument after the command to indicate which app you wish to migrate to the previously applied migration.
