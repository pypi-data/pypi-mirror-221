My FastAPI Application
======================

A simple FastAPI application that prints "Hello, World!" when accessed.

Installation
------------

You can install the package using `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install hellow_worldo

Usage
-----

Once the package is installed, you can import and use it in your Python scripts or projects.

Import the package in your script:

.. code-block:: python

   from hellow_worldo import print_hello

Use the function to print the greeting:

.. code-block:: python

   response = print_hello()
   print(response)  # Output: {'data': 'Hellow Worldo..'}


Running the Application
-----------------------

To run the FastAPI application, execute the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   uvicorn myapp:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Replace ``myapp`` with the name of your Python script containing the FastAPI application (the script where you define the FastAPI app using ``app = FastAPI()``).

Once the application is running, you can access it by navigating to ``http://localhost:8000/`` in your web browser or using an API client like curl or Postman.
