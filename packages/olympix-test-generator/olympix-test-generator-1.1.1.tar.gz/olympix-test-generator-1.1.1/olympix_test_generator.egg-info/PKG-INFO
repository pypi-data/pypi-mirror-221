Description: # Olympix Test Generator
        
        Olympix Test Generator is a Python package designed to assist with the generation of unit tests for Solidity smart contracts. These unit tests are specifically designed to be ran through [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), a tool for writing unit tests in Solidity. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install Olympix Test Generator using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install olympix-test-generator
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The package includes a command-line interface for generating tests.
        
        Before running the script, make sure to set the `OLYMPIX_API_KEY` environment variable in your system.
        
        To generate a test, run:
        
        ```bash
        olympix generate
        ```
        
        The tool will guide you through the process of generating the test.
