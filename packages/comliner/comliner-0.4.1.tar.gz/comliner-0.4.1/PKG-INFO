Summary: Command Line Interface Wrapper for Python Functions. Wrap your Python functions with a simple command line interface, so that they can be run directly from the command line, just like any shell command.  This is achieved by simply adding a decorator in front of the function and creating a small standardized executible script.

comliner - Command Line Interface Wrapper for Python Functions
==============================================================

Make programs out of your Python functions that can be run from the command
line by simply adding a decorator in front of the function. The programs will
have a commandline interface based on the optparse module, and load data from
and save data to files (HDF5 format).
