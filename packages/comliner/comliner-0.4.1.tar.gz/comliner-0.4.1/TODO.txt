# To do / Future Ideas

--> enable parallel execution if in independent execution mode
--> warn about usage with interactively defined functions? (no __name__)
--> be able to specify a fixed file, so instead of "$1/some/dataset", be able
    to specify "some/file.h5/some/dataset" (as well for output)
    setting default values in input mapping would then only be possible for
    non-strings (strings were already restricted before, could not start with
    "$", "%" or "#")
--> allow dynamic mappings, containing placeholders like {option=default}
    (also multiple), so that options can be used to set dsetnames/paths or
    also filenames/paths
--> allow slices in mappings, like "$1:/dset" (all but the first file) or
    "$:4" (the first four arguments) or "$:" (all arguments, equivalent to
    "$@")
--> case dep+@: be able to restrict number of input/output arguments
    (min/max)?
--> understand combined filename/dataset paths, including patterns in both
    parts of the path (feature which is already provided through h5obj.tools)
--> in addition, access dataset attributes, e.g. inmap=dict(a='$0/dset/attr')
--> enable comliner configuration options --preproc and --postproc? (update dict)
--> even if no arguments are expected at all, make sure the function is still
    executed
--> reroute STDOUT and STDERR to file? could be important for parallel
    execution. DENIED!
--> if default value is True (or bool in general), behave accordingly
--> convert Comliner class to a function (not really neccessary, but cleaner)
--> enable timings in milliseconds, reformat, make a new _nicetime function
    mapping
--> allow "$0" in output mapping (as a source), e.g. to access filename
--> option to "close gaps", i.e. only execute if output datasets do not yet
    exist
--> enable option to omit missing input datasets also in sequential mode?
--> option to omit whole file when one of the input datasets is missing?
