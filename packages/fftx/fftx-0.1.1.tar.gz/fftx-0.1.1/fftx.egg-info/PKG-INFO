This Python package provides NumPy/CuPy-compatible access to the high performance multi-platform code generation capabilities of the FFTX Project.  The package provides a single API for several FFTs, along with some convolution-like transforms, that run on either CPUs or GPUs (NVIDIA and AMD) and supports single and double precision and both C (row-major) and Fortran (column-major) arrays.  The API uses the dimensions, datatype, ordering, and location of an array to determine which variant of a transform to invoke, simplifying application code intended for multiple target environments.
