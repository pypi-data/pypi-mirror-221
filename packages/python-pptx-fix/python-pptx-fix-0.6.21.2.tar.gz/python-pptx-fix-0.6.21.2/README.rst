*python-pptx-fix* is a Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint (.pptx)
files.

This project `python-pptx-fix <https://github.com/kascodeo/python-pptx>`_ is 
created to fix bugs and add minor features to the original project 
by `Scanny <https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx>`_. Original project is 
unresponsive at the moment so had to create this project as *python-pptx-fix*. 
Feel free to contribute to this project.


A typical use would be generating a customized PowerPoint presentation from
database content, downloadable by clicking a link in a web application.
Several developers have used it to automate production of presentation-ready
engineering status reports based on information held in their work management
system. It could also be used for making bulk updates to a library of
presentations or simply to automate the production of a slide or two that
would be tedious to get right by hand.
