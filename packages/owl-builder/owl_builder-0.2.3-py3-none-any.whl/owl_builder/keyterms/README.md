# autotaxo = Automated Taxonomy Builder
This service will take any input of any length and generate a well-constructed and fully automated Taxonomy fit for OWL use immediately.

## Sample Usage (DataFrame)
```python

from pandas import DataFrame
from tabulate import tabulate

from owl_builder.keyterms.svc import GenerateTaxonomyDataFrame

input_text = """
A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building. By contrast, a wide area network (WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits. Ethernet and Wi-Fi are the two most common technologies in use for local area networks. Historical network technologies include ARCNET, Token Ring, and AppleTalk.
"""

svc = GenerateTaxonomyDataFrame()
df = svc.process(
    top_n=10,
    input_text=input_text)
```

and the result is

## Sample Usage (TTL)

Optionally run This
```python
from owl_builder.keyterms.svc import GenerateTaxonomyTTL

ttlgen = GenerateTaxonomyTTL()
results = ttlgen.process(df)
[print(x) for x in results]
```

The results looks like this (abbreviated):
```ttl
###  http://graffl.ai/pathology#area_network
            :area_network rdf:type owl:Class ;
            rdfs:label "Area Network" ;
            rdfs:subClassOf :network .

###  http://graffl.ai/pathology#network
            :network rdf:type owl:Class ;
            rdfs:label "Network" .

###  http://graffl.ai/pathology#local_area_network
            :local_area_network rdf:type owl:Class ;
            rdfs:label "Local Area Network" ;
            rdfs:subClassOf :area_network .

###  http://graffl.ai/pathology#area_network
            :area_network rdf:type owl:Class ;
            rdfs:label "Area Network" .
```

These results can be pasted directly into an OWL file.
