## Quick start
setuptools-github helps to implement a simple project life cycle
aimed at delivering packages into [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

Install it with:
```bash
pip install setuptools-github
 or
conda install -c conda-forge setuptools-github
```
### Add secrets
First you need to install the secrets for the **package-name** repository
[here](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/settings/secrets/actions)
- TWINE_PASSWORD
- TWINE_USERNAME
- CODECOV_TOKEN


### Setup the master branch
Create a new `src/package_name/__init__.py` file to store the package information:
```
__version__ = "N.M.O"  # replace N, M and O with numerical values (eg. 0.0.0)
__hash__ = ""  # leave this empty
```

Fix the setup.py file:
```
from setuptools_github import tools
initfile = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "package_name/__init__.py"
setup(
  name="package-name",
  version=tools.update_version(initfile, os.getenv("GITHUB_DUMP")),
  ...
```
Copy over the github workflow files:
- [github/workflows/master.yml](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/blob/master/.github/workflows/master.yml)
- [github/workflows/beta.yml](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/blob/master/.github/workflows/beta.yml)
- [github/workflows/tags.yml](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/blob/master/.github/workflows/tags.yml)

Most likely you might need to change `tests/requirements.txt` file.

THAT IS ALL! Now when commiting to the master branch, this will trigger the 
github action to run tests and quality checks on the code 
(see the Rationale section below).

### Setup the beta/N.M.O branch

You must create a beta branch using the little script:
```python

python -m setuptools_github.script make-beta 
or
setuptools-github make-beta
```

This will generate the **beta/N.M.O** branch out of the master branch.

Adds the secrets in https://github.com/<username>/<project-name>/settings/secrets/actions:
- TWINE_PASSWORD
- TWINE_USERNAME

Then for each commit into **beta/N.M.O** a package will be generated as
**package-N.M.O.bX** on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) (if all tests pass!).


## Rationale
setuptools-github helps to implement a simple project life cycle
aimed at delivering packages into [PyPI](https://pypi.org): 
there are three important components, the **master** branch, 
the **beta** branch and the **release** tags.

`/master branch` this is the branch where all commit go 
(as well the PR from feature branches).
On each commit the CI will run code quality checks as:
  - running flake8
  - running mypy
  - running all pytest + coverage

(see [github/workflows/master.yml](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/blob/master/.github/workflows/master.yml) for an example)

`/beta/N.M.O branch` branch is where code is merged to release the *beta*
packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org).   
On each commit into this branch, the CI will:
  - run flake8
  - run mypy
  - run pytest + coverage (see *.github/workflows/master.yml*)
  - create wheel such as **package-N.M.O.bX**
  - (optional) publish the wheel to [PyPI](https://pypi.org)

(see [github/workflows/beta.yml](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/blob/master/.github/workflows/beta.yml) for an example)

> NOTE: the **X** in the **package-name-N.M.O.bX** is a unique increasing 
> build number taken from GITHUB build environment.

`/release/N.M.O` is a release tag.
Once the code is stable enough on the **/beta/N.M.O** branch that is the
time to release a formal **package-N.M.O**.

So tagging on **/beta/N.M.O** with a **/release/N.M.O** tag will direct the
CI to:
  - create wheel such as **package-name-N.M.O**
  - (optional) publish the wheel to [PyPI](https://pypi.org)

(see [github/workflows/tags.yml](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/blob/master/.github/workflows/tags.yml) for an example)

> WARNING: there won't be any check/test run on the tagged code, so it
> it important the tagging happen on **/beta/N.M.O** branch
