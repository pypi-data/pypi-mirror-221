## Intro
setuptools-github helps to implement a simple project life cycle
aimed at delivering packages into [PyPI](https://pypi.org): 
there are three important components.

#### /master branch
This is the branch for CI build and code quality checks as:
  - run flake8
  - mypy
  - pytest + coverage
    (see *.github/workflows/master.yml*)

Work from other feature branches get integrated here, for testing.

#### /beta/N.M.O branch
This branch (on each commit) will generate a 
beta **package-N.M.O.bX** into [PyPI](https://pypi.org).
**X** denotes a unique increasing build number.
  - run flake8
  - mypy
  - pytest + coverage
    (see *.github/workflows/master.yml*)
  - packaging the wheel for **package-N.M.O.bX**
  - (optional) publish the 

Changes from **/master** branch get pushed here, to prepare for packaging
into *beta* packages: these are continuosly released and they can 
be used for integration testing.

#### /release/N.M.O tag
On tagging a commit in a **/beta/N.M.O** branch will delivere the 
formal package **package-N.M.O** into [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

> **NOTE:** All packages include a __version__ and __hash__ variables, used to
> link the generated package with the source code.

## Quick start

Start from the */master* branch:

**Setup the version file**

We will use src/package_name/__init__.py to store the package information:
```
__version__ = "N.M.O"  # replace N, M and O with numerical values (eg. 0.0.0)
__hash__ = ""  # leave this empty
```

**Add the setup data**

In setup.py add:
```
from setuptools_github import tools
initfile = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "your_package/__init__.py"
setup(
  name="package-name",
  version=tools.update_version(initfile, os.getenv("GITHUB_DUMP")),
  ...
```

**Copy the github actions**

Copy all github action files from 
[workflows](https://github.com/cav71/setuptools-github/tree/release/0.3.0/.github/workflows)

## Development
Once the setup is done, the workflow is rather simple.

### /master branch
Commit into the **master** branch and for each commit CI (github) will:
  - run flake8
  - mypy
  - pytest + coverage
    (see *.github/workflows/master.yml*)

### /beta/N.M.O
Create a new beta branch to start creating packages on PyPi:
```bash
setuptools-github src/package/__init__.py make-beta
```
(assuming src/package/__init__.py contains the __version__ variable)

* Create and use a **beta/N.M.O** branch to integrate work from **master** and for each commit CI (github) will:
  - run flake8
  - mypy
  - pytest + coverage
  - (optional) send the coverage to codecov
  - create a **beta** wheel as **package-N.M.Ob#1234** (1234 is a sequential build number)
  - publish it into pypi.org as beta package

* Once ready for full release `setuptools-github-start-release micro src/your_package/__init__.py`:
  - create the tag **beta/N.M.O** pointing to the latest **releaase/N.M.O** commit
  - this will trigger the **release** wheel as **package-N.M.Ob** creation
  - publish it into pypi.org as released package

**setuptools-github** is fully CI/CD integrated (github actions) to eliminate any manual step involved
with software deployment (except code writing).


Project Setup
=============

First add a "version" file in the source code eg. src/package_name/__init__.py with a content like this:


The generated package provides two important variables (auto updated from the code leveraging automation):

   #. __version__ with the code version
   #. __hash__ with the has commit where the code originates from

To enable..

**Step 1** in your setup.py file::

   from setuptools_github import tools
   initfile = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "your_package/__init__.py"
   setup(
        name="a-name",
        version=tools.update_version(initfile, os.getenv("GITHUB_DUMP")),
        ...

*__init__.py* will contain the __version__ and __hash__ variables.

**Step 2** in your .github/workflows/{beta,master,release}.yml action files::

    - name: Build wheel package
      env:
        PYTHONPATH: .
        GITHUB_DUMP: ${{ toJson(github) }}
      run: |
        python -m build

That's all! everytime you'll push code into a branch/N.M.O or tag with release/N.M.O the packages
will be have the __version__/__hash__ variables auto generated.

Initial steps (setup.py)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First add into the **setup.py** file the function handling the __version__/__hash__ variables::

   from setuptools_github import tools
   initfile = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "your_package/__init__.py"

   # this will manage the __version__/__hash__ in initfile using the github envs
   version = tools.update_version(initfile, os.getenv("GITHUB_DUMP"))

   setup(
        name="a-name",
        version=version,
        ...

.. NOTE::
   If the your_package/__init__.py is not present it will be created on the fly when setup.py is run.

Second update the **.github/workflows/{beta,master,release}.yml**

Adds to the workflows yaml files the following::

    - name: Build wheel package
      env:
        PYTHONPATH: .
        GITHUB_DUMP: ${{ toJson(github) }}
      run: |
        python -m build

This will set the environment variable GITHUB_DUMP to a json string from the action context.

Release process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin a new branch from **master**::

    setuptools-github-start-release micro src/your_package/__init__.py

This will create a new branch beta/0.0.0 initially where your-package will build 0.0.0b1, 0.0.0b2 etc. wheels.

Tagging beta/0.0.0 as release/0.0.0, will close the branch and you can restart a new branch::

    setuptools-github-start-release micro src/your_package/__init__.py

This will (1) bump the master __version__ to 0.0.1 (micro), and create a new beta/0.0.1 branch.


The master branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **master** holds all the integration work coming from other **dev** branches and for each push
the code undergo the following steps:

    #. unit and integration testing
    #. code coverage
    #. static code check
    #. style check

No package artifact are generated here as the code is not "installable" (eg. is still in source version).

The delivery branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is branching **master** into a "delivery" branch using the **beta/N.M.O** name convention.

package deliveries using beta branches on github:
in a simple model each (automated) commit on a beta/N.M.O branch will result in a package with a __version__
of N.M.Ob<build-number> and a __hash__ corresponding to the commit.

Finally tagging the code with a release/N.M.O tag will result in a package of __version__ N.M.O and "close"
the beta branch (this is the same sorting strategy used in `pep440`).

A script **setuptools-github-start-release** will help to start a beta release branch.

We start from the master branch (or main, depending on the repository setting).
