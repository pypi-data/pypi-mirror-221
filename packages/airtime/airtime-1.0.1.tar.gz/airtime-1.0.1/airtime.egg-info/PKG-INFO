# Airtime

This package contains Python scripts for analyzing meeting transcripts from Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings. The scripts read the transcript files, calculate spoken word totals for each speaker, and print out the analyzed results.

The intended purpose of this package is to allow users to determine what percentage of a given meeting was allocated to which speaker(s), with the goal of fostering better collaborative environments among teams in future meetings.

## Version

The latest version of this package is v1.0.1.

## Installation and requirements

```
pip install airtime
```

This package uses only the Python standard library.
No external dependencies are required to run these scripts.

## Usage

After installing the package, it can be used as follows:

- For analyzing transcripts from Zoom meetings:

```
from airtime import zoom_analzyer

zoom_analzyer.analyze_zoom_transcript("transcript.txt")
```

**Note**: recent releases of Zoom will output several transcript formats, but only one of these formats will preserve the speaker names which are essential to this analysis. To access the required transcript format, *before the meeting ends*, navigate to Captions > View full transcript > Save transcript.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- For analyzing transcripts from Microsoft Teams meetings:

```
from airtime import teams_analzyer

teams_analzyer.analyze_teams_transcript("transcript.vtt")
```


## Output
These scripts print:

- Meeting totals (total words and total speakers)
- Speaker totals (total words per speaker and their contributed percentage to the meeting total)

Example output:

```
MEETING TOTALS
- 1,000 words
- 2 speaker(s)

SPEAKER TOTALS
- Holmes: 900 words (90.0% of meeting)
- Watson: 100 words (10.0% of meeting)
```

## Contributing

Contributions to this package are welcome, and especially in the form of introducing additional transcript formats from other services (e.g., Google Meet). Please open an issue to discuss your idea or submit a Pull Request.
