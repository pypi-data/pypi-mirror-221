# Project Description
This package provides:
* Useful capabilities to solve and plot numerical methods problems with heavy reliance on NumPy and Pandas.
* Evaluation and derivation of lambda expressions.

Docstrings formatted according to NumPy's [convention](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) wherein the latest API documentation is generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

_Capability to interact with the Python module `logging` has been included._
