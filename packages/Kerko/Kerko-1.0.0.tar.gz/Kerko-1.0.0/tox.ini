# tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# TODO: Move this to pyproject.toml when tox natively supports it. https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/999
