This package provides a simple client and server for the Battleship game.
It tries to be roughly compatible with the Collaborative Software Design implementation.
Behind the scenes, it uses `WebSocket`_ for communication between client and server.

Client Usage
------------

The entire client functionality is encapsulated by ``battleship_mp.client.GameSession``.
This allows to join a game, transmit a board of set ships, and exchange shots.
Note that the server does **not** perform any notable game state evaluation;
multiplayer peers **must** exchange their game state (notably, their entire game board)
to locally check the game progress.
See the class' description on how to use it.

Set the environment variable ``BMP_SERVER_URL`` to the server's websocket URL.
For example, if the server runs locally on port ``8765``
then use ``BMP_SERVER_URL="ws://localhost:8765"`` before starting the program.
Alternatively, this can also be set inside Python by using
``os.environ["BMP_SERVER_URL"] = "ws://localhost:8765"``.

Server Usage
------------

The server is self-contained and does not need to be embedded in a program.
It can be run directly from the command line, requiring a port and optionally
the addresses/hostnames to bind to.
For testing, it is suitable to bind to ``localhost``:

.. code:: bash

    ~ $ python3 -m battleship_mp.server 8765 localhost

See the ``--help`` flag for options.

Installation
------------

You can install the package directly via ``pip``;
only Python >= 3.8 is required.

.. code:: bash

    ~ $ python3 -m pip install kcsd-battleship-mp
