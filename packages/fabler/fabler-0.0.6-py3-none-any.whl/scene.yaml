  On the evening of June 14, 2023, a man named John Smith was found murdered in his home.
  The police arrived at the scene and began their investigation, and it quickly became clear that the killer was someone close to John.
  As they looked into John's personal life, the detectives learned that he had been having an affair with his secretary, Mary Thompson.
