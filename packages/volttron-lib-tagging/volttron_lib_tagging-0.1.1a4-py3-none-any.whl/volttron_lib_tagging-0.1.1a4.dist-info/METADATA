VOLTTRON base tagging library that provide common tagging api for users to associate haystack based tags and values to 
topic names and topic name prefixes. Implementing agents can persist tags in specific data store. 

Tags used by this library have to be pre-defined in a resource file at volttron_data/tagging_resources. The
library validates against this predefined list of tags every time user add tags to topics. Tags can be added to one 
topic at a time or multiple topics by using a topic name pattern(regular expression). This library uses tags from 
[project haystack](https://project-haystack.org/) and adds a few custom tags for campus and VOLTTRON point name.

Each tag has an associated value and users can query for topic names based tags and its values using a simplified 
sql-like query string. Queries can specify tag names with values or tags without values for boolean tags(markers). 
Queries can combine multiple conditions with keyword AND, and OR, and use the keyword NOT to negate a conditions.

## Requirements

 - Python >= 3.10

## Installation

This library can be installed using ```pip install volttron-lib-tagging```. However, this is not necessary. Any 
implementing tagging agent that uses this library will automatically install it as part of its installation. 
For example,  installing [SQLiteTaggingAgent](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlite-tagging) will 
automatically install volttron-lib-tagging into the same python environment

## Dependencies and Limitations

1. When adding tags to topics this library calls the platform.historian's (or a configured historian's) 
   get_topic_list and hence requires a platform.historian or configured historian to be running, but it doesn't require 
   the historian to use sqlite3 or any specific database. It requires historian to be running only for using this 
   api (add_tags) and does not require historian to be running for any other api. 
2. Resource files that provides the list of valid tags is mandatory and should be in 
   data_model/tags.csv
3. Tagging library only provides APIs to query for topic names based on tags. Once the list of topic names is retrieved, 
   users should use the historian APIs to get the data corresponding to those topics. 
4. Current version of tagging library does not support versioning of tag/values. When tags values are set it will 
   overwrite any existing tag entries in the database
