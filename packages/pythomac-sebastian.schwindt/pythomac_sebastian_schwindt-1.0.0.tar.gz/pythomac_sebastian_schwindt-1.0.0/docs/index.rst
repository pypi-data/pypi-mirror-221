Pythomac
==========

The open-source software Telemac for numerical modeling already comes with a suite of powerful Python scripts. But running Telapy scripts often only works in the Telemac environment, which might not be necessary for post-processing of simulation results. This Python3 package comes with light-weigth requirements to extract and manage data generated with and for Telemac.
