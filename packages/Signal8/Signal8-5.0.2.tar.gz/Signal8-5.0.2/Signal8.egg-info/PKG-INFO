# An Extension of Multi-Agent Particle Environment

Signal8 is an enhancement on top of the Simple environment, originally developed by the [Farama Foundation](https://farama.org/) as part of their [Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/mpe/).

# Signal8

Signal8 is an open-source research project aimed at advancing the development of communication strategies in multi-agent systems. The project proposes a unique environment that emphasizes the principles of the Lewis signaling game. This distinct setting serves as a testing ground for advancing robot-to-robot communication protocols.

Each problem set within Signal8 introduces different constraints on entity positioning such as start points, goals, and obstacles. This dynamic aspect encourages the investigation of communication strategies in diverse settings, enhancing the environment's adaptability and realism.

A notable characteristic of Signal8 is its incorporation of asymmetric information, whereby two types of agents â€“ an 'eye in the sky' agent with global information and ground agents with only local information â€“ operate simultaneously. This asymmetry replicates real-world situations, presenting challenges for the development of efficient communication strategies. It also provides intriguing prospects for the generation of context-dependent language and high-level directives.
