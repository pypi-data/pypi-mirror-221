### About hdss
Shape recognition is an essential property of the human intellect. We recognize objects even 
if they differ in size, position, orientation, or are severely deformed. For example, we quickly 
identify *hearts* in the image below.

Such distorted forms, "hand-drawn shapes," are handy to test various recognition technologies.

we show how to use **hdss package** to generate these objects by using two simple python functions.
