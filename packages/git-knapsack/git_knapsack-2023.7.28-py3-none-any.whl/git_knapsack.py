`git_knapsack.py`

Knapsack untracked files in a git repository in many commits, so that each commit does not exceed 30 MB.
Currently, the knapsacking algorithm is extremely naive, and it does not expose any custom git features.
Effectively, this scripts performs git add, git commit and git push.

Note that it also will commit and push any untracked file.
If you run git status before this command and see anything you don't want committed,
either delete it or add it to the .gitignore file.

If any single file exceeds the git server's file limit or commit size limit, this script will not be able to help you.

The dependencies of this script are gitpython and tqdm.
